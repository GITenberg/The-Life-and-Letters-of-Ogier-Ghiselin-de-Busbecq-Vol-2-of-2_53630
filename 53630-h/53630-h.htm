<p>In illustrating Busbecq’s letters from France reference is frequently
made to contemporary writers, and it may be useful to the
reader to have some idea of their different characters, and positions,
and of the historical value of their statements.</p>

<p>(1). J. A. de Thou, the historian, son of Christopher de Thou, President
of the Parliament of Paris. Jurist and statesman. Busbecq’s intimate
friend and warm admirer. Quoted as <cite>Thuanus</cite>. Edition, Geneva,
1620, &amp;c.</p>

<p>(2). Pierre de l’Estoile. Audiencier de la Chancellerie de Paris. A
quiet man, who took no part in politics. He kept a diary which is generally
known as <cite lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Journal de Henri III.</cite> and <cite lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">>Henri IV.</cite>, but is really <em>his
own private diary</em> during the reigns of those monarchs. Quoted as <cite lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">De
l’Estoile</cite>. Edition, Paris, 1875, &amp;c.</p>

<p>(3). Pierre de Bourdeille, Abbé and Seigneur of Brantôme. Soldier
and courtier. Gentleman of the Chamber to Charles IX. and Henri III.
His ideas are those of the French Court of that period, and consequently
his standard of morality is very low. He was a friend of Alençon, du
Guast, Bussy, de Viteaux, La Noue, &amp;c., and a great admirer of Marguerite,
to whom he dedicated several of his works. Having been disabled
by a fall from his horse, he devoted his last years to writing memoirs of
the celebrated men and women he had known, a treatise on duelling, &amp;c.
Quoted as <cite lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Brantôme</cite>. Edition, Paris, 1822.</p>

<p>(4). Marguerite de Valois, wife of Henry of Navarre, sister of Charles
IX., Henri III., and Alençon, wrote an autobiography which she addressed
to Brantôme. Quoted as <cite lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Mémoires de Marguerite</cite>. Edition, Paris,
1842.</p>

<p>(5). Theodore Agrippa d’Aubigné. Friend and adherent of Henry of
Navarre. He wrote a <cite lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Histoire universelle</cite> and <cite lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Mémoires</cite>. Quoted as
<cite lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Aubigné, Histoire</cite>. Edition S. Jean d’Angely, 1616, &amp;c. The <cite lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Mémoires</cite>
are quoted from the Panthéon Littéraire. Paris, 1836.</p>

<p>(6). Louis Gonzaga, Duc de Nevers. Soldier and statesman. The
compilation known as his Memoirs is quoted as <cite lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Mémoires de Nevers</cite>.
Edition, Paris, 1665.</p>

<p>(7). Venetian ambassadors:—John Michel, sent in 1575 to congratulate
Henri III. on his coronation and marriage. Jerome Lippomano, ambassador
in 1577-1579. Their reports are contained in <cite lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Collection de
Documents inédits sur l’Histoire de France, Première Série, Relations
des Ambassadeurs Vénitiens</cite>. Quoted as <cite lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Ambassadeurs Vénitiens</cite>.</p>

<p>(8). Guillaume and Michel Le Riche. Avocats du Roi at Saint-Maixent
in Poitou. Their Journal is quoted as <cite lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Le Riche</cite>. Edition, Saint-Maixent,
1846.</p>

<p>(9). Famianus Strada. A Jesuit priest who wrote the history of the
wars in the Netherlands. Motley has drawn largely from his work.
Quoted as <cite>Strada</cite>. Edition, Rome, 1648.</p></div>

<h3>LETTER I.</h3>

<p class="noindent"><span class="smcap">Yesterday</span>, August 21, I arrived at Speyer. I stayed
a day at Salzburg and another at Augsburg, on account
of my health. For at my third stage from Vienna an
attack of hæmorrhage came on, unaccompanied, however,
by pain, or any great derangement of the system.
The physicians I consulted at Salzburg and Augsburg
told me that, if I neglected it, the consequences might
be serious, and ordered me to rest for some days. For
my own part, till now I saw no reason for interrupting
my journey for any length of time, but, as I observe
that this trouble, whatever it may be, is aggravated by
heat and motion, I intend to stay here over to-morrow,
for fear of more haste perhaps proving to be worse
speed. In order to save time, I have abandoned my
project of passing through the Netherlands, and intend
to go directly to Metz by easy stages, as my health
will not admit of rapid travelling. As to the King
of France, I can learn nothing here; no one knows
where he is, but he is said to be going straight to
Rheims, which lies, I imagine, on my road, and I hope
to get there before him.</p>

<p>When I passed through Munich, the Duchess, the
sister of your Majesty,<a name="FNanchor_1_1" id="FNanchor_1_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_1" class="fnanchor">1</a> who had lately returned from
a visit, sent to me, and made particular inquiries about
the health of your Majesty, of the Empress, and your
children. She also gave me messages for the Queen
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">4</a></span>of France, and sent letters to Augsburg next day for
me to take to her.</p>

<p>I was speaking to someone to-day who had come
but lately from the Prince of Orange, and he said that
negotiations<a name="FNanchor_2_2" id="FNanchor_2_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_2" class="fnanchor">2</a> for peace had been opened with him
through St. Aldegonde, who was a prisoner in the
hands of the Royalists. He represented the Prince
as strongly inclined for peace, but said that the cities,
which had called him in, were no less strongly opposed
to it, and would rather suffer the worst extremity than
trust themselves to the Spaniards, or send Orange
away. The same person told me that Leyden was
starving, and must soon surrender.<a name="FNanchor_3_3" id="FNanchor_3_3"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_3" class="fnanchor">3</a> The Prince, he
said, was not to blame for it, but the inhabitants, who,
having been repeatedly warned to lay in stores in time,
had obstinately neglected to do so. He also informed
me that the Spanish fleet, if it was really coming, was
to sail round Scotland, and that Orange had set up
false beacons and lights on the coast to draw it among
the shoals and sandbanks.</p>

<p>Perhaps the information I have sent your Majesty
is not of much importance, still I feel sure that it will
at least do no harm, and that with your accustomed
graciousness you will not take my sending it amiss. I
pray God to preserve your Majesty, and remain, &amp;c.</p>

<h3>LETTER II.</h3>

<p class="noindent"><span class="smcap">On</span> September 2 I arrived at Meaux, fourteen<a name="FNanchor_6_6" id="FNanchor_6_6"></a><a href="#Footnote_6_6" class="fnanchor">6</a> miles
from Paris. My journey was delayed by want of post-horses,
for, as the King had just gone to Lyons, they
had almost all been transferred to that road from their
proper stations, and so for two days and nights I sailed
down the Marne, but, as it winds very much before its
confluence with the Seine, near Paris, I had to change
my mode of travelling, and return to land. As no
horses or carriages were to be had, I sent people to
Paris to get some, and also to look for lodgings against
our arrival. When the Queen, your Majesty’s daughter,
knew of this, she sent two of her own carriages, which
brought me and my suite to Paris on the 4th.</p>

<p>On that day the Queen<a name="FNanchor_7_7" id="FNanchor_7_7"></a><a href="#Footnote_7_7" class="fnanchor">7</a> wished me to rest, and did
not send for me till the next day. I found her in
excellent health, but her face was melancholy, and still
showed traces of her recent loss. As I was going
through the points mentioned in my instructions, she
spoke gratefully of your Majesty’s thinking of her and
sending to console and visit her in her bereavement.
She was not surprised, she added, at the deep regret
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">6</a></span>expressed by your Majesty, for, indeed, her late Consort
had always felt the warmest affection for you, and had
always been most anxious to meet your wishes. She
then made very minute inquiries about your Majesty’s
health. But, when I said that she must wait patiently
till your Majesty should be able to decide, according
to the turn events might take, whether she was
to leave or stay, she gently replied, that all she asked
was to be allowed to do that which was most useful
and pleasing to her father. Our conversation then
ended, and I received permission to retire.</p>

<p>The next day the Queen again ordered me to be
summoned, and during the interview I contrived to
introduce the question of her marriage to the new King
(Henry III.) by alluding to the reports now current;
many people set her down as his future bride, I remarked,
and if the union were to take place, it would,
in my opinion, harmonise with your Majesty’s views
and policy. Her reply was such as to make it perfectly
plain the suggestion was by no means to her liking;
and yet I could see that she did not intend to be obstinate;
she will, I am sure, place herself in her father’s
hands, and further his interests and wishes by every
means in her power.<a name="FNanchor_8_8" id="FNanchor_8_8"></a><a href="#Footnote_8_8" class="fnanchor">8</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">7</a></span></p>
<p>I also touched on the Constantinople matter, as
your Majesty directed. She promised to bear it in
mind when the Queen Mother returned. I will then
make it my business to remind her of it.</p>

<p>I went to her a third time to ask that, as your
Majesty’s principal reason for sending me here was
that I might look after her interests, she would kindly
give orders to the <em lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">maréchaux de logis</em> to provide me
with proper quarters in the neighbourhood, and she at
once complied with my request.</p>

<p>As to other matters, there is no news of any importance.
The King is expected to arrive at Lyons today,
where the Queen Mother, Alençon, and Vendôme<a name="FNanchor_9_9" id="FNanchor_9_9"></a><a href="#Footnote_9_9" class="fnanchor">9</a>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">8</a></span>have been for some time awaiting him. Disturbances
are still going on in Poitou and the neighbouring provinces.
The King, they say, is preparing to exert his
influence, and, if need be, to put them down with a
strong hand. He has hired 5,000 Swiss, besides
reiters from Germany, and some thousands of Italian
musketeers.</p>

<p>With regard to our business, not much, I see, can
be done here while the King is away, and so, if I was not
afraid I might transgress the rules of etiquette, I should
like to run home for a few days. But I cannot make
up my mind, as I hardly know what people here
might think; otherwise I see no objection, as I had
your Majesty’s permission.</p>

<p>Montmorency and Cossé<a name="FNanchor_10_10" id="FNanchor_10_10"></a><a href="#Footnote_10_10" class="fnanchor">10</a> are still confined in the
Bastille, and both are so strictly guarded by the people,<a name="FNanchor_11_11" id="FNanchor_11_11"></a><a href="#Footnote_11_11" class="fnanchor">11</a>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">9</a></span>that passers-by cannot so much as bow to them without
danger.</p>

<p>Yesterday there arrived here Master John Koch,
whose misfortune has been a great grief to me. Today
I took the letters he brought to the Queen, and
she immediately answered them.</p>

<h3>LETTER III.</h3>

<p class="noindent"><span class="smcap">A few</span> days ago I sent such news as I had by way of
Brussels; I now write, more because I have a convenient
opportunity of forwarding a letter, than because
I have anything particular to tell.</p>

<p>The King arrived at Lyons on the 6th. His army
is besieging the town of Nove,<a name="FNanchor_12_12" id="FNanchor_12_12"></a><a href="#Footnote_12_12" class="fnanchor">12</a> twelve miles from
Lyons, which they think will not be hard to take, as it is
commanded on every side by the adjoining hills. Still,
they are not quite confident, as they know how obstinate
the King’s opponents have hitherto been in defending
the places they have occupied. Montpensier<a name="FNanchor_13_13" id="FNanchor_13_13"></a><a href="#Footnote_13_13" class="fnanchor">13</a>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">10</a></span>is besieging the town of Fontenay; a capitulation, they
say, was agreed on, but his men refused to accept it,
preferring to risk their lives in storming the place,
rather than forego their plunder, so the result is still
uncertain. Great is the strength of despair, and however
things may turn out, their spoils, I warrant, will
be blood-stained.</p>

<p>They say that the King, before he reached Lyons,
asked his Council’s advice, as to whether he should
send back the Italian troops he had brought with him
as a body guard, and that Pibrac,<a name="FNanchor_14_14" id="FNanchor_14_14"></a><a href="#Footnote_14_14" class="fnanchor">14</a> whom your Majesty
saw at Vienna, was for dismissing them. This gave
offence to the Queen Mother, and on his arrival at
Lyons she ordered him to return to Paris, and resume
his duties as Advocate of the Kingdom. The Queen
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">11</a></span>Mother, people think, is in favour of war, because she
hopes thereby to retain her power.</p>

<p>Damville,<a name="FNanchor_15_15" id="FNanchor_15_15"></a><a href="#Footnote_15_15" class="fnanchor">15</a> they say, received an unfavourable
answer from the King, and consequently remained at
Turin; he has now, I hear, been summoned by the
King; a suspicious circumstance, as many think. It
will be two months, it is supposed, before the King gets
away from his affairs at Lyons, and in the meantime
business here makes little progress. I expect the King
and the Queen Mother will give your Majesty an account
of what is passing in France. At any rate I feel
justified in saying that everybody is anxiously looking
for a marriage between the King and your Majesty’s
daughter—it is the general topic of conversation.</p>

<p>The Comte de Bailen, after being kept for a long
time in Gascony by the dangers of the road, has at last
started for Lyons.</p>

<h3>LETTER IV.</h3>

<p class="noindent"><span class="smcap">I have</span> despatched two letters to your Majesty since I
arrived here, one I sent by way of Brussels, the other,
dated the 17th, was given to a servant of the Duke of
Bavaria, who was travelling this way from Spain.
<span class="pagenum2"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">12</a></span>Now I have a convenient opportunity of sending
despatches by the hands of Master John Koch.</p>

<p>The King has determined to continue the war
rather than suffer two religions in his kingdom, or
allow the rebels to remain in possession of the towns
they have seized; while they declare that they will
hold them to the death, having no hope of safety left
save in their walls and their despair. Thus the King
is again getting entangled in difficulties, from which
he will not easily free himself, and which he might
perhaps have avoided.</p>

<p>Fontenay, the town about which I wrote lately, fell
at the third assault. There was great slaughter both of
besiegers and besieged. People think Lusignan will be
attacked next. It is a fortress of considerable strength,
five miles from Poitiers, and being built on a rock is not
easily accessible.<a name="FNanchor_16_16" id="FNanchor_16_16"></a><a href="#Footnote_16_16" class="fnanchor">16</a> The siege of Lusignan will give Mont<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">13</a></span>pensier’s
army occupation for some time, and though
less important places like these may be easily recovered
by the King, at any rate the reduction of Montauban,
Nismes, Rochelle, and other towns, which still hold
out, will prove a more difficult task. But who can
say what may happen in the meanwhile? Time brings
about many a surprise, and the result may turn out far
other than what it is expected to be. The King thinks
differently; under his mother’s influence, as it is supposed,
he is entering on the war with a light heart.
Within the last few days an Edict<a name="FNanchor_17_17" id="FNanchor_17_17"></a><a href="#Footnote_17_17" class="fnanchor">17</a> was published, by
which all who had fled the country are invited to
return home within six months, under promise of an
amnesty; if they do not avail themselves of this act of
indemnity within that time, they are to be considered
outlaws and public enemies. This proclamation, it is
feared, will be the signal for those who distrust the
King’s word to take the field—it is the trumpet calling
them to battle. To people’s astonishment some noble
families, as, for instance, those of Rambouillet and
d’Estrées,<a name="FNanchor_18_18" id="FNanchor_18_18"></a><a href="#Footnote_18_18" class="fnanchor">18</a> have been ordered to leave the Court and
retire to their homes.</p>

<p>At his parting from the Duke of Savoy, the King
is said to have made him a present of two towns which
are still held by his garrisons—namely, Savigliano and
Pignerolo, if I remember the names rightly. This
arrangement, however, has been interfered with by
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">14</a></span>the Duke’s wife having died, unfortunately for him,
before it was completed, an event which may possibly
make the King change his intentions.<a name="FNanchor_19_19" id="FNanchor_19_19"></a><a href="#Footnote_19_19" class="fnanchor">19</a></p>

<p>I am far from satisfied with the state of the business
which is the principal object of my mission—namely,
the settlement of the Queen’s dower. The
King’s return, I suspect, is further off than people
think, and meanwhile nothing can be done here. The
Queen is thus left in a state of uncertainty; she knows
not what is to happen, or what her position is to be,
and therefore she naturally feels by no means comfortable.
Some people think the King will go down to
Avignon, to be nearer the seat of the war which is
imminent; and, if so, it is supposed he will not be in
Paris for full six months from this. If this be true,
though sufficient provision has been made for her in
the meantime, still perhaps it is hardly creditable that
a lady, who is now practically your Majesty’s ward,
should be left dependent on another’s beck and call,
and sit quietly waiting till it pleases him to ask her to
become once more a wife. Such a position is, in my
humble opinion, a highly improper one; nor do I believe
that in any other case the relatives of a widowed
queen ever waited so long before taking steps to protect
her interests. I trust your Majesty will consider
what is to be done. Shall I go to the King—which
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">15</a></span>will involve some expense—or shall I write to him,
or shall I wait here for his return, whenever that may
be?</p>

<p>If I may give my opinion, I think the King is likely
to have more trouble than he expects. For, taking
even the most favourable supposition, and assuming
that he reduces a great part of the rebels to submission,
I consider that he cannot possibly complete his
task during the present winter, and that many of them
will hold out still. What then will be the King’s
position? His forces will be no longer what they
were at the beginning of the campaign; war, privation,
and winter will have thinned their ranks. On
the other hand, we must be prepared to see the exiled
nobles now in Germany come to the succour of their
friends with such troops as they can raise. All France
will then be in a blaze once more; the issue of the
contest it is impossible to foretell, for who can say how
many secret allies the rebels can reckon on? Those
who are thoroughly estranged from the King are not
a few.</p>

<p>This forecast of future probabilities is derived in
great measure from a conversation I had, when I was
passing through Kaiserslautern, with an intimate friend
of the Palatine and Casimir.<a name="FNanchor_20_20" id="FNanchor_20_20"></a><a href="#Footnote_20_20" class="fnanchor">20</a> The exiles I speak of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">16</a></span>have been prevented from invading the country chiefly
by two motives: in the first place, they had some
hopes that the King would be more indulgent to their
party, and wished to give him a trial; secondly, among
their chiefs are two sons of the Constable,<a name="FNanchor_21_21" id="FNanchor_21_21"></a><a href="#Footnote_21_21" class="fnanchor">21</a> and they
saw that if they stirred it would be the signal for the
execution of their imprisoned brother, Montmorency;
the Queen Mother has openly threatened and declared
as much. Perhaps, too, they are influenced by the
consideration that it would be very bad policy to choose
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">17</a></span>the moment when the King’s forces are at their best
for attacking him, instead of biding their time.</p>

<p>To turn to another subject. A few days ago a
gentleman, who is one of the King’s councillors, came
to see me, and gave me a book to send to your Majesty,
to whom it is dedicated by the author. It is the
work of François de Foix, Bishop of Aire, and Privy
Councillor to the King. He is an old man of the
highest rank, and is a great scholar. He is also a near
relative of your Majesty, for his father, he states in his
letter, was brother of your Majesty’s grandmother on
the mother’s side.<a name="FNanchor_22_22" id="FNanchor_22_22"></a><a href="#Footnote_22_22" class="fnanchor">22</a> His elder brother, the Comte de
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">18</a></span>Candale, is dead. He left a son, who was killed by a
musket-shot in the head,<a name="FNanchor_23_23" id="FNanchor_23_23"></a><a href="#Footnote_23_23" class="fnanchor">23</a> while fighting under Damville,
who was then engaged in some service for the
King. He left only two daughters, the eldest of whom
succeeded to the family property, and is being brought
up in the house of her maternal grandmother, the
widow of the Constable, their father having married
one of the Constable’s daughters. To return to the
Bishop. He is a man of the greatest learning, especially
in mathematics, and is regarded by the professors
of that science here as one of their most distinguished
men. He has translated Hermes Trismegistus<a name="FNanchor_24_24" id="FNanchor_24_24"></a><a href="#Footnote_24_24" class="fnanchor">24</a>—a
writer of such antiquity that some people make him
out to be a contemporary of Moses himself—from Greek
into Latin, and this is the work that is now on its way
to your Majesty. He has also translated him into
French, and has dedicated the translation to the
Queen Mother. He has written, besides, five books
of commentaries on the same author in French, which
those who have seen it assert to be a noble work; and
this has been published under the patronage of the
Queen, your Majesty’s daughter. I humbly hope your
Majesty, when answering my letter, will condescend
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">19</a></span>to acknowledge the arrival of the book, and gratify
the good old man by thanking him for the compliment.
I will take care to show the passage to his friends, who
brought me the book.</p>

<p>As to the Queen’s condition, I have nothing to
write which your Majesty will not hear from her own
letters. One matter, I think, I should not omit to
mention. Everything here is exceedingly dear, especially
the necessaries of life, such as bread, wine, fire-wood,
and lodgings. With these high prices, I do not
see how I am to keep within the salary allowed by
your Majesty. However, I will do the best I can for
this half year, and after that I trust your Majesty will
kindly see that I am properly provided for.</p>

<p>To conclude. As I perceive there is no immediate
prospect of the King’s arrival, and I can leave Paris
for some days without any inconvenience to the Queen,
I have determined, with her approval, to avail myself
of your Majesty’s kind permission, and to make the
journey home, which I have so long intended, to arrange
my private affairs. I think of remaining in the
Netherlands till your Majesty’s gracious reply to this
letter arrives at Brussels, which I consider your Majesty
will find to be the most convenient route for
sending an answer. I have nothing more to add except
my earnest prayer that God may long preserve
your Majesty to us and to Christendom.</p>

Cossé, on account of his illness, is allowed a more convenient

<p>I am not sure if it is worth adding a postscript to

<hr />
<h3>LETTER V.</h3>

<p class="noindent"><span class="smcap">I have</span> but lately sent all the news I had by the hands
of Master John Koch. Since then nothing has happened
worth notice, except that letters from Lyons
have reached Paris, saying that the question of the
Queen’s dower has been discussed at Court, and that
the Duchy of Berry has been assigned to her on account
thereof. The annual income, however, of this
Duchy, derived from real estate, does not come up to
the amount of her dower; whence the rest is to be
provided we do not know, but it certainly ought to be
charged on lands in the neighbourhood. The Queen
herself has not heard a word on the subject, though
the King has written several times to her, and the
Queen Mother still more frequently. The report I
mention about the dower prevents my starting for the
Netherlands, as I had intended, for I am afraid of
perhaps being wanted here.</p>

<p>As to the King’s return, nothing is yet known for
certain: some think it is not near, and that he intends
going further away; others regard his movements as a
trick to induce the gentlemen of the Court to start for
the camp, under the notion that the King will shortly
follow. I can make no positive assertion either way;
I have not been long in France and am at a distance
from the scene of action; hitherto I have been unable
to do more than chronicle rumours and people’s<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">21</a></span>
opinions. Your Majesty must excuse it, therefore, if I
am occasionally wrong in my facts or mistaken in my
predictions.</p>

<p>One part of the Royal army is besieging Poussin,<a name="FNanchor_25_25" id="FNanchor_25_25"></a><a href="#Footnote_25_25" class="fnanchor">25</a> a
castle fortified by the Huguenots, on the bank of the
Rhone, a little below Vienne, I believe, and not many
miles from Lyons. The rest of it is with Montpensier,
besieging Lusignan, which is garrisoned, they say, by
about 600 soldiers and 200 gentlemen. La Noue,<a name="FNanchor_26_26" id="FNanchor_26_26"></a><a href="#Footnote_26_26" class="fnanchor">26</a> the
head of the rebels, is said to be at Rochelle with such
a following, that they think he will be master of the
town. As to Damville, some people have a story
that, when he found the King intended to arrest him
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">22</a></span>and put him to death, he crossed by sea from Savoy to
Montpellier, a city in his government, and that he has
induced it with some of the neighbouring towns to
revolt. Of this, however, there is nothing known for
certain, and I suspect it is somebody’s invention.</p>

<p><small>Paris, October, 1574.</small></p>

<hr />
<h3>LETTER VI.</h3>

<p class="noindent"><span class="smcap">I lately</span> despatched a letter to your Majesty by a
running footman, whom I sent to Brussels to bring
back the answer I am expecting from your Majesty.
Since then nothing new has occurred except that the
Queen was threatened with an attack. The symptoms
were sickness, accompanied by general inflammation
and irritation of the skin, while at night she suffered
from thirst. Physicians were called in, and they declared
it to be a case of bile in the blood; they said
that there was danger of fever if remedies were not
promptly employed. Accordingly, they treated her
with purgatives and bleeding; since then there has
been a change for the better, and the physicians now
have great hopes that the attack has been taken in
time, and this is also my view. The Queen herself is
in good spirits, and considers herself as well as before
the illness. Still I should not like to leave your
Majesty in ignorance of what has happened.</p>

<p>A few days ago the Comte de Bailen arrived from
Lyons to offer the Queen the condolences of the King
of Spain; he had already expressed his master’s regret
to the King and Queen Mother at Lyons. He was kept
a long time at Bordeaux by the dangers of the road,
and he incurred serious risks on his way round by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">23</a></span>
Lyons, as parties were watching at various places on
his route with intent to waylay him. He is now hesitating
as to what road he shall choose for his return,
and seems to think the safety of his route a more important
consideration than its length. He has, moreover,
a wish to visit the Netherlands and other countries.</p>

<p>To-day I was informed that Pibrac is coming here
from Lyons; from him I shall be able to learn how
matters stand there. He is also bringing, they say,
the King’s instructions to me with reference to the
dower. Your Majesty shall be duly informed of whatever
I hear.</p>

<p>Poussin, which was being besieged, has fallen into
the King’s hands; the defenders, according to some
accounts, sallied out by night and escaped from the
town.<a name="FNanchor_27_27" id="FNanchor_27_27"></a><a href="#Footnote_27_27" class="fnanchor">27</a> Damville’s conduct excites suspicion; two
Vicomtes are said to have come to him at Montpellier
to concert plans for war. One of them, I think, is the
Vicomte de Montbrun; the other’s name I have not
heard. Damville is also believed to have tried to take
Avignon by surprise; people think that he will raise
the standard of a fresh insurrection, and thus exasperate
the King, who is at present inclined towards justice and
mercy, as your Majesty will see from the Edict<a name="FNanchor_28_28" id="FNanchor_28_28"></a><a href="#Footnote_28_28" class="fnanchor">28</a> I enclose.
There seems, therefore, to be no prospect that
France will see any termination of the woes with which
she is afflicted. One civil war begets another, until there
is no end.</p>

<p>About the King’s coming there are vague reports,
which change every day. I cannot be sure of anything
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">24</a></span>till I have an interview with Pibrac, and, as soon as I
have seen him, I will lose no time in making my report
to your Majesty.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>Paris, October 31, 1574.</p></blockquote>

<hr />
<h3>LETTER VII.</h3>

<p class="noindent"><span class="smcap">In</span> my last letter to your Majesty I gave an account of
the Queen’s health; and how her physicians hoped to
keep off a fever by timely remedies. Unhappily, a
few days later, though the Queen had felt no inconvenience
in the mean time, there was a return of the
complaint, and it was found necessary to repeat the
medicines and to bleed her again. The blood that
was taken was very corrupt, so much so that her
physicians became anxious, feeling sure that her illness
would be serious, and possibly dangerous. They called
in some of the first physicians in Paris, and held a
consultation. The attack, however, never became
dangerous, and on the fifth day there was a decided
improvement, and on the seventh, which was Sunday,
the fever had quite subsided. Her physicians are not
yet altogether free from anxiety, as there is still some
derangement of the system, which they are endeavouring
to remove; the Queen, however, now the
fever has left her, is not in the least nervous about
herself. Thanks to God’s mercy, she is in a fair way
towards recovery.</p>

<p>There is another matter, as to which it is essential
to have explicit instructions from your Majesty. From
the beginning of next January the Queen, they say,
will have her dower assigned to her, and instead of
living as hitherto at the expense of the State, she will<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">25</a></span>
have to maintain herself on her own resources and out of
the revenues of her dower. Consequently there are
several points that present themselves for your
Majesty’s consideration. In the first place, your Majesty
will have to indicate the source from which the
Queen is to get money for her maintenance till her own
revenues begin to come in; secondly, your Majesty
will have to decide whether she is to remain here for
the winter, so as to have milder weather for her journey,
or to return immediately. If the last course is
preferred, your Majesty will have to settle all the questions
relating to her route, the expense to be incurred,
the suite that is to attend her, the road she is to take,
and her ultimate destination. If, on the other hand,
there is not time to make all these arrangements, and
it should be therefore decided that she shall stay some
months longer in France, still a decision must be
come to as to whether she is to remain in Paris, or
retire to the place assigned her as dower. For there
can be no question that she will live at much less
expense in her own house, if I may call it so, than
here in Paris, where everything is excessively dear.
There is a château in the Duchy of Berry which would
just suit her, called Remorantin; the Queen Mother
herself is said to have sometimes thought of retiring
thither. Apart from any questions of economy, a
residence in the country would be more in keeping
with her position as a widow. Assuming this to be
settled, your Majesty’s opinion will be required as to
all the arrangements of her new establishment, and the
gentlemen and ladies who are to constitute her household.
Nothing can be determined till I receive your
Majesty’s instructions.</p>

<p>I mentioned in my former letter that the Duchy of
Berry is to be assigned to the Queen, and I have now<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">26</a></span>
written that after the first of January she is to live at
her own charges. Both these statements are founded
only upon current report and require confirmation, for
neither the Queen, nor the Comte de Fiesco,<a name="FNanchor_29_29" id="FNanchor_29_29"></a><a href="#Footnote_29_29" class="fnanchor">29</a> nor I
have received any official notice on the subject. However,
the fact is in itself so probable and the rumour
has become so general, that neither the Comte nor myself
have any doubt of its truth. I heard from one of
Pibrac’s relatives in Lyons that he would shortly be
here to discuss the whole question with me on behalf
of the King. However, he has not arrived yet, though
he is expected every day. I shall lose no time in informing
your Majesty of the result of our interview.
In the meantime I have thought it better to send this
letter without waiting for his arrival.</p>

<p>The report, which was at first very general, of the
King’s intending to marry your daughter, is now universally
discredited. Some people, whose opinion is
worth having, ascribe the cause to the Sorbonne or
College of Divines in Paris. When King Henry VIII.
of England began to question the validity of his mar<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">27</a></span>riage
with his deceased brother’s widow, and wanted
to have it declared null, these divines were consulted
as to the lawfulness of the marriage. At the instigation
of King Francis I., who wished to gratify the
King of England, knowing that the dissolution of the
marriage would dissolve the alliance between the Emperor
Charles and Henry, they pronounced the marriage
unlawful and incestuous, in opposition to all the
other divines and jurists before whom the case had
been laid.<a name="FNanchor_30_30" id="FNanchor_30_30"></a><a href="#Footnote_30_30" class="fnanchor">30</a> This decision being so contrary to the
general opinion, King Francis thought it sufficient to
forward it to England, and wished it to be suppressed as
far as possible in France. But the King of England,
being anxious to support his case, had the decision
printed, and published far and wide. This precedent
is supposed to be a great stumbling-block to the King,
and to make him have scruples of the lawfulness of a
marriage with his brother’s widow, as he would thereby
seem to question the authority of his ancestor’s decision.</p>

<p>This is one version of the story; whether it be the
true one, or simply an excuse, I cannot tell for certain.
I fully expect that when I have had a talk with Pibrac
I shall be able to make out more of this matter, or at
any rate to form a tolerably good guess; for even if
he says nothing I shall be able from his very silence
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">28</a></span>to draw my own conclusions as to the King’s wishes
and intentions.</p>

<p>It is considered certain that the King will go down
to Avignon. His object, I imagine, is to be nearer
the scene of action, where his presence is required.
Meanwhile the siege of Lusignan continues. As to
other matters, I cannot venture to make any positive
assertion. The Comte de Bailen will, I understand,
leave this to-morrow on his way back to Spain. He
intends going to Nantes, a seaport in Brittany, and
thence taking ship for Bilbao or St. Sebastian. He has
chosen this as being by far the shortest route as well
as the safest.</p>

<p>I most humbly entreat your Majesty for an early
answer to this letter, for, until we have your instructions,
we cannot bring this business to a conclusion
with credit to your Majesty. I would suggest sending
the answer to Leonhard de Taxis<a name="FNanchor_31_31" id="FNanchor_31_31"></a><a href="#Footnote_31_31" class="fnanchor">31</a> at Brussels, who has
promised to use all speed in forwarding your Majesty’s
letters to Paris.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>Paris, November 9, 1574.</p></blockquote>

<p>I told your Majesty that we were expecting Pibrac
in Paris. Well, he has arrived, and as we were old
friends, having made each other’s acquaintance when
the King of France was staying at Vienna, I went and
called on him. He returned my visit. I took the
first opportunity which offered itself in the course of
our conversation of introducing the Queen’s business,
and expressed my surprise at the delay in the assign<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">29</a></span>ment
of the dower. He replied that affairs of this
kind could not be arranged in a hurry, and that matters
would be set right if I went to the King myself.</p>

<p class="noindent"><span class="smcap">I have</span> little to add to what I told your Majesty in
my last two letters of the Queen’s health. She is still
confined to her bed by the orders of her physicians,
but she looks well, and is in excellent spirits. There
is no need for me to say more, as she is writing to
your Majesty herself.</p>

<p>Pibrac arrived three days ago. I lost no time in
calling upon him, to ascertain whether he had any
instructions with regard to the Queen’s dower. He
avoided the subject, and talked of Poland, and a message
the King had received from a Diet held at Warsaw,
begging him to return forthwith. He told me that the
Turkish Ambassador had been present at the meeting
of the Diet, and informed the Poles that the Sultan
would make it a <em>casus belli</em> if they elected a Muscovite
or one of your Majesty’s sons to the vacant throne:
they must appoint one of their own countrymen, two of
whom he specified as proper candidates. It was supposed,
however, that it was at the instigation of these
two gentlemen that the embassy had been sent. Pibrac
then observed that there was one of your Majesty’s
subjects who was looking out for the throne.</p>

<p>I remarked that an absent king was not likely to
keep his crown long. He agreed, and was of opinion
that the Poles would soon be engaged in fighting with
each other.</p>

<p>The conversation flagged, and as he made no allu<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">30</a></span>sion
to the subject in which I was interested, I introduced
it myself. I told him that there was a rumour
that the Queen’s dower had been assigned. He informed
me that the report was correct, and represented
the settlement which had been made as most advantageous
to the Queen. He said that he understood
your Majesty intended arranging a marriage for the
Queen with the King of Portugal. I replied that I
knew nothing of the matter beyond the fact that the
King of Portugal had been most anxious to obtain her
hand before her marriage. At present, I added, he
was too much engaged with his expedition against
Fez.<a name="FNanchor_32_32" id="FNanchor_32_32"></a><a href="#Footnote_32_32" class="fnanchor">32</a></p>

<p>It appears from my conversation with Pibrac that
the Queen will not receive her dower till January, and
I am anxious to know what arrangement your Majesty
proposes for providing her with funds in the meantime.<a name="FNanchor_33_33" id="FNanchor_33_33"></a><a href="#Footnote_33_33" class="fnanchor">33</a></p>

<h3>LETTER IX.</h3>

<p class="noindent"><span class="smcap">On</span> Saturday last I despatched a letter to your Majesty
by a gentleman who paid a visit to the Queen on behalf
of the King and Queen Mother, as he told me that
on his return to Lyons the Seneschal of that city would
be sent to your Majesty. The Queen also wrote a
letter, which I enclosed. I wrote in such a hurry that
I am afraid my letter is hardly as clear as it should be;
I trust your Majesty will, with your usual kindness,
pardon its shortcomings.</p>

<p>The purport of my letter was that the Queen was
convalescent, and that her dower was to commence on
the 1st of January. She will then begin life afresh,
and her residence and the arrangements of her establishment
will depend upon your Majesty’s pleasure.
I humbly trust that your Majesty will make such provision
as the case requires.</p>

<p>I understand that in similar cases the widows of
French Kings have been sent home with a French
retinue at the charge of the royal treasury; but I see
that the Queen’s officials are anxious as to the source
from which funds are to be provided until her revenues
shall begin to accrue, for her debts are already large,
and will be still greater by January 1. At that date
she will not owe less than 50,000 francs. The King
ought to pay the money, but I am afraid he will not do
so punctually, and in that case her creditors are likely
to become troublesome. I am also anxious as to her
income, for I fear that, whatever reductions are made
in her household, she will have difficulty in meeting
her expenses if she remains in France.</p>

<p>As to other matters, there is not much for me to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">32</a></span>
say, except that the King’s affairs are far from prosperous.
The besieged garrison of Lusignan has made
a successful sally, and Montpensier has lost so many
men that he is compelled to raise the siege. Some
companies also of the Comte de Retz’s forces, with a detachment
of cavalry, have likewise, they say, been cut
to pieces by Damville’s troops. Damville is believed
to be full of confidence, and busy in making preparations
for defence. He holds a commission as Condé’s
lieutenant. There are fears that Condé himself will
take the field, and that troops will be raised in Germany.
In confirmation of this, we hear that the people
of Rochelle have sold a large quantity of salt to German
traders, whose ships are lying in their harbour,
and that the proceeds are to be placed to the credit of
Condé in Germany, for the purpose of hiring soldiers.
If this be true, it is very serious news for France.</p>

<p>As to the King’s views with regard to marriage, I
cannot speak with any certainty. Some think that
he has set his heart on Monsieur de Vaudemont’s
daughter, who is a very handsome girl. Besides, the
King is devoted to the House and party of Lorraine,
and most anxious for its advancement.</p>

<p>However, if he marries her he will cause tongues
to wag, and give offence to those who from interest or
jealousy are opposed to the party of Lorraine. Amongst
these must be numbered Vendôme, Condé, and possibly
Alençon himself, who will suspect—not without
reason perhaps—that this marriage is only the thin end
of the wedge.</p>

<h3>LETTER X.</h3>

<p class="noindent"><span class="smcap">I received</span> your Majesty’s two letters dated October
31, and also my instructions, on November 23. I was
at Paris when they arrived, having abandoned my visit
to the Netherlands for reasons with which your Majesty
is already acquainted.</p>

<p>I informed the Queen of your Majesty’s wishes,
and at the same time delivered the letter. I took the
opportunity of ascertaining her views as to the desirability
of my visiting the King in accordance with
your Majesty’s instructions. She thought it advisable,
on the grounds mentioned by your Majesty. I asked
her to think the matter over, and when I had an interview
with her the next day she was still of the same
opinion.</p>

<p>Also I asked her whether the King (Charles IX.)
had made a will before he died? She replied in the
negative, telling me that he had only given verbal
instructions on certain points; she was quite sure he
had made no will. I believe the Queen is right, for so
far I have not heard from anyone of his leaving a will.
I will, however, make further inquiries.</p>

<p>A few days after I had written my last letter to
your Majesty, the Bishop of Paris,<a name="FNanchor_34_34" id="FNanchor_34_34"></a><a href="#Footnote_34_34" class="fnanchor">34</a> who is the Queen’s
Chancellor, paid me a visit, and we were shortly afterwards
joined by the Comte de Fiesco and Monsieur
de France, the Queen’s first steward. We discussed
the question of the dower; the last two gentlemen
expressed their doubts as to the possibility of getting
the pension of 20,000 francs usually granted to Queens
Dowager charged on a good security, quoting the case
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">34</a></span>of the Queen of Scots, whose pension was settled in
such a way as to be absolutely worthless.</p>

<p>It would be of the greatest advantage to the Queen,
your Majesty’s daughter, if she could have the command
of 10,000 or 12,000 thalers to meet her expenses
until the revenues of her dower shall begin to accrue.
I think we could manage without money in hard cash,
if a credit could be opened at Lyons or Antwerp, so
that we might be able to draw on our agents. My duty
to your Majesty and the Queen, my mistress, renders
it incumbent on me to make this suggestion, but I shall
gladly acquiesce in your Majesty’s decision, whatever
it may be.</p>

<p>Your Majesty mentions ‘credentials.’ I have not
received them, and I think they would be of some
service to me; for if anyone should challenge my
right to act as the Queen’s representative, I have no
authority to produce except my letter of instructions,
and I should not care to have its entire contents made
public.</p>

<h3>LETTER XI.</h3>

<p class="noindent"><span class="smcap">I set</span> out on the journey which I had undertaken at the
desire of your Majesty, and arrived at Lyons December
12. There I waited a couple of days for the purpose
of making inquiries as to the remainder of my route,
and obtaining what was needful for the road.</p>

<p>I felt it my duty to have an interview with the
Spanish Ambassador and ascertain from him how matters
were going on. His Excellency had been ordered
to remain at Lyons with the other ambassadors, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">35</a></span>
there await the King’s arrival; but he had a still more
imperative reason for remaining—to wit, the gout!</p>

<p>He advised me most kindly with regard to my
journey, telling me much of the dangers to be encountered,
both on the river route and that by land,
and recommending me strongly not to go to Avignon.
I think he would have persuaded me, had I not sent
for some boatmen who had lately made the voyage;
from them I ascertained that matters were not nearly
so bad as the Ambassador had represented; there was
a risk, but no certainty, of our being attacked. Accordingly,
not wishing to waste my time at Lyons,
where no intelligence was to be obtained of the movements
of the King—nor, indeed, any news at all—and
thus displease both your Majesty and the Queen, I determined
at all hazards to continue my journey.</p>

<p>Accordingly I embarked at Lyons on the 15th, and
reached Avignon on the 17th.<a name="FNanchor_35_35" id="FNanchor_35_35"></a><a href="#Footnote_35_35" class="fnanchor">35</a> By God’s mercy, I
encountered no difficulty or danger on the way, and
found the road far safer and pleasanter than I had been
led to expect. Not that it was altogether safe, for
at Valence Bishop Montluc,<a name="FNanchor_36_36" id="FNanchor_36_36"></a><a href="#Footnote_36_36" class="fnanchor">36</a> (the chief negotiator in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">36</a></span>the Polish business), when he came on board to pay
his respects, advised me to take with me six musketeers,
as people had been stopped in the neighbourhood,
and some had been killed. I followed his advice.</p>

<p>I had an audience of the King on the 19th of the
same month, and was received most kindly. On my
delivering your Majesty’s message and letter, together
with that of the Empress, he answered in very handsome
terms, that for your Majesty’s sake he would do
all that lay in his power for the Queen, and spoke at
great length of the attentions and kind services he had
received at your hands. The Queen Mother (Catherine
de Medici), to whose presence I was admitted a few
days later, held similar language; she had been suffering
from constant sickness, which prevented her giving
me an earlier interview. I ascertained later that the
King had sent letters to the Queen at Paris touching
the dower, and that, contrary to the usual custom, they
had been registered by the Parliament of Paris before
being presented to the Queen. I called on his Majesty
and made some objections to his proposal. The King
said he must refer the matter to his council, and also
wait for an answer from the Queen’s advisers. He
spoke of your Majesty’s kindness at great length, and
specially of the assurances he had lately received,
through Vulcob,<a name="FNanchor_37_37" id="FNanchor_37_37"></a><a href="#Footnote_37_37" class="fnanchor">37</a> that he would have your Majesty’s
support if he cared to keep his kingdom of Poland.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">37</a></span></p>
<p>In the course of our conversation I discovered that
the King would do whatever the Queen Mother wished,
so I determined to approach her again and ask for her
services on behalf of the Queen. She professed the
utmost willingness and said, she would do her best for
the Queen, who had been an excellent daughter to her.</p>

<p>A few days later, de Morvilliers,<a name="FNanchor_38_38" id="FNanchor_38_38"></a><a href="#Footnote_38_38" class="fnanchor">38</a> the Bishop of
Orleans, and the Bishop of Limoges called on me and
we had a long discussion with regard to the dower. I
must not forget to mention that, when the King told
me that your Majesty had offered to assist him in keeping
his kingdom of Poland, I was much surprised, but
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">38</a></span>made no reply, as I thought it might possibly be a trap.
I wonder also that nothing has been said as to the non-payment
of the marriage portion<a name="FNanchor_39_39" id="FNanchor_39_39"></a><a href="#Footnote_39_39" class="fnanchor">39</a>; I am afraid they
are keeping this argument in reserve.</p>

<p>I must not forget to inform your Majesty that, in
the course of my interview with the Queen Mother, she
told me she felt assured of the kindly feeling which
your Majesty entertained for her, because your Majesty
had continually advised her against war, whereas those
who wished her ill had given the opposite counsel.
She had followed your Majesty’s advice, she said, for
a long time, and thereby exposed herself to severe
criticism from not a few.</p>

<hr />
<h3>LETTER XII.</h3>

<p class="noindent"><span class="smcap">To-day</span> the King set out from Lyons on his way to
Rheims, where he is to be crowned—as he told me
himself—on the 13th.</p>

<p>I will not weary your Majesty with a full description
of the state of France, but content myself with a sketch.</p>

<p>Ever since the commencement of the civil wars
which are distracting the country, there has been a
terrible change for the worse. So complete is the
alteration, that those who knew France before would
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">39</a></span>not recognise her again. Everywhere are to be seen
shattered buildings, fallen churches, and towns in ruins;
while the traveller gazes horror-stricken on spots which
have but lately been the scenes of murderous deeds
and inhuman cruelties. The fields are left untilled:
the farmer’s stock and tools have been carried off by
the soldier as his booty, he is plundered alike by Frenchman
and by foreigner. Commerce is crippled; the towns
lately thronged with merchants and customers are now
mourning their desolation in the midst of closed shops
and silent manufactories. Meanwhile, the inhabitants,
ground down by ceaseless exactions, are crying out at
the immense sums which are being squandered for
nought, or applied to purposes for which they were
never intended. They demand a reckoning in tones
which breathe a spirit of rebellion. Men of experience,
members of the oldest families in France, are in many
cases regarded with suspicion, and either not allowed to
come to Court, or left to vegetate at home. Besides
the two parties into which Frenchmen are divided by
their religious differences, there are also feuds and
quarrels which affect every grade of society.</p>

<p>In the first place, the feeling against the Italians
who are in the French service is very strong; the high
promotion they have received and the important duties
with which they have been intrusted, arouse the
jealousy of men who consider them ignorant of French
business, and hold that they have neither merit, services,
nor birth to justify their appointment. Birague,
as Chancellor, holds one of the highest offices in the
kingdom; Comte de Retz<a name="FNanchor_40_40" id="FNanchor_40_40"></a><a href="#Footnote_40_40" class="fnanchor">40</a> is a Maréchal; Strozzi is
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">40</a></span>in command of the infantry of France; Guadagni is
Seneschal of Lyons; and in the same way other
Italians occupy most important posts, while Frenchmen
murmur.</p>

<p>Again, Italians farm nearly all the taxes, and exact
their dues so rigidly as to drive the natives, who are
unaccustomed to such extortion, to the very verge of
rebellion; there will be another Saint Bartholomew<a name="FNanchor_41_41" id="FNanchor_41_41"></a><a href="#Footnote_41_41" class="fnanchor">41</a>
if they do not take care, and they will be the victims.</p>

<p>The feuds which separate the leading families of
France are more bitter than those described in ancient
tragedy; this is the state of feeling which exists
between the Houses of Guise, Vendôme and Bourbon,
not to mention that of Montmorency, which, through
its alliances and connections, has a considerable party
of its own.</p>

<p>The Bourbons are the strongest; the Guises have
most influence at Court, but this is an advantage which
they may lose any day by the death of the King, and
then their fall is inevitable.</p>

<p>By his nearest relations the King is feared rather
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">41</a></span>than loved, for, knowing the designs they entertained
before the death of his brother (Charles IX.), they
have no confidence in his mercy and forgiveness,
though he professes to have pardoned them, and think
that his vengeance is only deferred for a time. On
the other hand, the King must see clearly from the
flight of Condé what the feelings of his own family are
towards him.</p>

<p>The district in which the rebellion on religious
grounds has struck its deepest roots begins at Rochelle
and reaches to the Rhone, comprising the whole of
Guienne and Languedoc: it includes Saintonge, Poitou,
the Limousin, Perigord, Gascony, the country round
Narbonne, &amp;c., &amp;c. Nor is this all; across the Rhone,
in Dauphiny itself, Montbrun has seized places, as,
for instance, Livron, which is now besieged by the
Royalists.</p>

<p>In making the statement that the rebels are powerful
in Languedoc and Guienne, I must not be understood to
say that the principal cities of those provinces do not
obey the King; my meaning is that the insurgents
occupy posts of vantage throughout the country,
which enable them to render both life and property
insecure; there is no peace or quiet for those who are
loyal to the King. To drive them from their fortresses
would be a most difficult task, for they have formidable
positions and strong fortifications, garrisoned by
veteran soldiers, who have made up their minds to die
rather than trust the King’s word. Such, undoubtedly,
is their determination, for though peace, which is the
only cure for these ills, has lately been freely mentioned,
and certain men were at Avignon from Condé and his
party, still, up to the present moment, no arrangement
has been concluded. True, the King is ready to pledge
his word that, if his towns are restored to him, no one<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">42</a></span>
shall be troubled on account of his religion; but the
memory of Saint Bartholomew<a name="FNanchor_42_42" id="FNanchor_42_42"></a><a href="#Footnote_42_42" class="fnanchor">42</a> is a fatal obstacle: they
will place no confidence in his promise, and believe
that it is only a stratagem to destroy the survivors of
that night.</p>

<p>Such acts of treachery, it would seem, never answer
in the long run, whatever the advantage at the time
may be!</p>

<p>Some people have a notion that the idea of peace
is not seriously entertained, but is simply a manœuvre
to break up the confederacy by making overtures to
some of its members.</p>

<p>Ambassadors, it is true, have been sent lately to
Rochelle, but in the meantime both parties are busy
fighting: the King is pressing on the sieges of Livron
and Lusignan, while the rebels are using every means
in their power to harass and perplex him. After the
King’s departure from Avignon, they took possession
of Aigues-Mortes,<a name="FNanchor_43_43" id="FNanchor_43_43"></a><a href="#Footnote_43_43" class="fnanchor">43</a> where they found a store of cannon,
which will be of great service to them. One fort, however,
still remains in the hands of the Royalists, and the
Duc de Uzes, who commands for the King, does not
despair of retaking the town under cover of its fire.</p>

<p>It is not that I should regard the situation as hope<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">43</a></span>less,
if there were a prospect of matters taking a turn
for the better, but, bad as is the present state of things, it is
nothing compared to what we may expect any day to see.</p>

<p>Having given my ideas as to the state of the
country, I will now give my opinion of the King. Of
his character your Majesty has had opportunities of
judging; he is naturally well disposed, and in the
hands of good advisers and councillors of sound judgment
might turn out a pattern sovereign. But his
companions are wild young men, the tone of French
society is licentious, and he listens to selfish intriguers
who are seeking their own advantage; under such
circumstances, who can say that he will not go astray?
Both he and his brother (Alençon) are of a weakly
constitution and not likely to be long-lived.</p>

<p>The ambassadors who came from Poland have
been ordered to remain at Lyons, and there await the
King’s arrival; it is supposed that his Majesty will
not care much for the despatches which they bring, as
they are couched in rough, not to say threatening, language.
It seems that the King has thoughts of keeping
Poland, for, though he is still a bachelor, he has announced
his intention of bestowing it on one of his
future children, and with this view is negotiating for
an alliance with the King of Sweden’s daughter; for
my own part, however, I am inclined to suspect that
this is a mere feint. First among the aspirants to the
Crown of Poland stands the Duke of Ferrara, but in
France the idea is that the Transylvanian<a name="FNanchor_44_44" id="FNanchor_44_44"></a><a href="#Footnote_44_44" class="fnanchor">44</a> is the candidate
most popular with the Poles. The King is dissatisfied
with the Duke of Savoy’s conduct with regard
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">44</a></span>to Damville, and it is supposed that, if what is past
could be recalled, he would not be so liberal with his
towns.<a name="FNanchor_45_45" id="FNanchor_45_45"></a><a href="#Footnote_45_45" class="fnanchor">45</a></p>

<p>It seems that the siege of Livron will be a long
business; for, though the wall has been battered with
cannon, and there is as wide a breach as the besiegers
could desire for them to mount to the attack, two
assaults have already been repulsed with heavy loss.
There are several reasons to account for these failures:
in the first place, the attacking column has to climb up
hill through the rubbish and <em lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">débris</em>, which crumble
away under their feet; secondly, fresh intrenchments
have been made within the circuit of the walls, and
the besieged are so confident of holding the town
that they may almost be said to laugh at the efforts of
their enemies.<a name="FNanchor_46_46" id="FNanchor_46_46"></a><a href="#Footnote_46_46" class="fnanchor">46</a> I saw this with my own eyes when I
passed Livron on my way back from Avignon. Thirdly,
when they come to close quarters, not only do they
meet with a most stubborn resistance from the men, but
many of them are also wounded by the women, who
rain stones upon them from the roofs and ramparts.
I saw six ensigns on the walls of the town, whence it
is assumed that there are 400 soldiers in the garrison;
they have muskets, but no cannon. His son-in-law,
who was in command of the town, having been killed
by a cannon-ball, Montbrun, the night before I arrived,
sent four more gentlemen into the place with a party of
soldiers; it is said that they passed through the outposts
of the German horse commanded by Count
Nogarola.</p>

<p>Your Majesty no doubt received intelligence long
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">45</a></span>ago of the death of the Cardinal of Lorraine.<a name="FNanchor_47_47" id="FNanchor_47_47"></a><a href="#Footnote_47_47" class="fnanchor">47</a> He
died of fever, after an illness of eighteen days. The
attack was brought on, people think, by his walking in a
procession of Flagellants, at night. The Queen Mother
has been poorly from the same cause, and her daughter
(Marguerite), wife of Vendôme (Henry of Navarre),
had a troublesome cold, which lasted several days.</p>

<p>There are four societies of Flagellants at Avignon;
the Cardinal enrolled himself in one of them, and advised
the King to do the same; his Majesty’s example
was followed by the whole of the nobility. On one
occasion, when they were walking in procession with
these societies at night, which is the usual time for
such ceremonies, there was a very cold wind, and
this is supposed to have been the cause of the Cardinal’s
illness and death, for two or three days afterwards he
fell sick.</p>

<p>He was a great man, and took a prominent part in
the government of the country. In him we have lost
a profound scholar, an eloquent speaker, an experienced
statesman. He was ever anxious to advance the in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">46</a></span>terests
of his party and his family, and I am by no
means sure that the State did not sometimes suffer in
consequence. The King visited him during his illness,
and would have gone to him oftener if he had not been
afraid of infection. He has felt his death deeply.
When the body was being removed from Avignon, on
its way to Rheims, the King and four Cardinals accompanied
it to the gates of the city. They were attended
by all the nobles of the Court, with the King’s brother
and the King of Navarre (as they style him here) at
their head. These last, I imagine, were by no means
sorry to do this honour, not to the Cardinal, but to his
corpse! He died at night, and the Queen Mother was
so upset by his death that the next day she fancied
she saw him bidding her farewell, and could hear him
saying ‘Adieu, madame; adieu, madame.’ She tried
to point him out to those who were with her.<a name="FNanchor_48_48" id="FNanchor_48_48"></a><a href="#Footnote_48_48" class="fnanchor">48</a></p>

<p>Whilst I was writing, news came that Lusignan
had surrendered to Montpensier. The garrison are to
be allowed to retire to Bouteville and Pons with their
arms and property. I hear also that the siege of Livron
has been raised; the attacking force is broken up; the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">47</a></span>men being quartered in the neighbouring villages, from
which they are to watch the town and see that no provisions
are brought in. They will have a hard task,
methinks, to keep up so strict a blockade, as not to be
sometimes given the slip.</p>

<h3>LETTER XIII.</h3>

<p>[The whole of this letter is occupied with business
connected with the dower. It is dated Paris, February
9, 1575.]</p>

<hr />

<h3>LETTER XIV.</h3>

<p class="noindent"><span class="smcap">I received</span> your Majesty’s letter of December 31 on
February 5, in which your Majesty graciously acquaints
me with the information touching the dower
given by the Seneschal of Lyons. On this head I
wrote at such length in my former letter that there is
no need for me to recur to the subject again. Your
Majesty next informs me that the Seneschal of Lyons
said that the Queen would be treated in the same
manner as during her husband’s lifetime, a statement
which, I think, must be considered one of mere politeness—in
short, a French compliment!</p>

<p>With regard to your Majesty’s questions as to the
manner in which the Queen will return, I understand
that the King will see that she is escorted to Vienna,
or whatever her destination may be, by gentlemen of
high rank and a distinguished retinue, following in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">48</a></span>
this respect the precedent of the Queen of Scots, whom
his predecessor (Charles IX.) sent to Scotland at his
own charges. The only expense that will fall on your
Majesty will be the presents that must be made to
those who accompany her, and the cost of their journey
when they return.</p>

<p>Before leaving, I asked what your Majesty’s wishes
were with regard to the cipher I was to use. I was
desired to draw up a code on my way, and forward
it to your Majesty. I drew up a code at Speyer, and
put it in a letter, of which I now enclose a copy. If
the letter arrived, I presume that the cipher arrived
too; in the other case, they will both have been lost
together. I send another code, which seems to me
less difficult. I am surprised that your Majesty has
not received the letter I wrote at the end of November,
before setting out for Avignon. Some of your
Majesty’s despatches to me are also missing—viz. those
dated December 11 and 16.</p>

<p>As to the state of France, matters are at a deadlock.
They would fain be at peace, for war means
ruin, and the very sinews of war are failing; but still
they insist on the restoration of the King’s towns as a
matter in which his honour is concerned. On the
other hand, the insurgents do not care for any peace
which does not furnish guarantees for their safety. As
to confidence, which is the very bond of human society,
they have lost it altogether, and will trust nought save
walls and fortifications.</p>

<p>Such a difference of views it is not easy to reconcile.
I think that anyone who offered to act as mediator
would be welcomed by the King, as he would
then be able to patch up a peace by pledging some one
else’s word. His own is absolutely worthless. But
who would care to pledge himself, when there are a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">49</a></span>
hundred ways in which his guarantee may be set
at nought?</p>

<p>Some, however, wish that a league could be made
against the Turk, and Condé sent to Hungary, with
large forces both of foot and horse, by way of pumping
out the water from which, according to their idea,
France is foundering.</p>

<p>But it is an idle scheme, for the object of the rebels
in making war is to protect their altars and firesides,
their children and their wives; and I fail to understand
by what argument they can be induced to abandon
all they hold dear, and allow themselves to be
sent to Hungary. This also is the opinion expressed
to me lately by Bellièvre,<a name="FNanchor_49_49" id="FNanchor_49_49"></a><a href="#Footnote_49_49" class="fnanchor">49</a> who was the late King’s ambassador
in Poland. Your Majesty saw him when the
King came to Vienna. He is a man who carries great
weight. He assured me in the most solemn manner
that the King, at his suggestion, had written during his
stay at Mantua, and again from France, to his ambassador
at Constantinople, ordering him to support your
Majesty’s interests, and that if he had done otherwise
he had distinctly disobeyed the orders of his master.<a name="FNanchor_50_50" id="FNanchor_50_50"></a><a href="#Footnote_50_50" class="fnanchor">50</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">50</a></span></p>

<p>The advice that your Majesty gave the King<a name="FNanchor_51_51" id="FNanchor_51_51"></a><a href="#Footnote_51_51" class="fnanchor">51</a>—viz.
that he should avoid war—is frequently mentioned both
by the Catholics and their enemies. They say the
King is sorry he did not adopt it, and preferred to enter
his kingdom with the gates of Janus wide open, instead
of closing them. Accordingly, Pibrac, who was the only
man for taking your Majesty’s advice, and stood alone
as the advocate of peace, though at first evil spoken
of, is now praised by all. The whole blame with
regard to the war is laid on the Cardinal and the
Queen Mother, the first of whom allowed his animosity
to carry him too far, while the other was afraid
that, if peace were declared, she would be reduced
to the level of a subject and find her reign at an
end.</p>

<p>I have now only to inform your Majesty of that of
which your Majesty must be already aware—viz. that
my funds are completely exhausted by my long and
expensive journey to Avignon, and that I have been
obliged to incur some debts. I therefore humbly petition
for the payment of my half-year’s salary to Jerome
de Cocq, who will arrange for its being remitted to me
here, in case your Majesty shall consider it advisable
to retain my services for the Queen.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>Paris, February 9, 1575.</p></blockquote>

<p>I trust your Majesty will not take it amiss that I
have been occasionally addressed as ambassador in
France; for, in spite of my protestations, I cannot
prevent their sometimes giving me this title. It mat<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">51</a></span>ters
the less because it is quite clear that I am not
your Majesty’s ambassador.</p>

<p>The Queen has just sent for me, to say that there
is a general report, which she hears on all sides, that
the King is on the point of marrying the daughter of
Vaudemont of Lorraine, and that the ceremony will be
celebrated next Monday, at Rheims. She does not know
how she ought to treat her with regard to precedence,
when she comes to Paris. I trust your Majesty will
deign to advise us on this matter. Possibly your Majesty
may think it advisable for the Queen to leave
Paris and go somewhere else—for instance, to her
daughter at Amboise, or to any other place your Majesty
may prefer.</p>

<p>I think I told your Majesty of this love-affair of
the King’s—in my letter dated November 16, if I
remember rightly. It is quite certain that this engagement,
which was a secret to all but a very few, and
might almost deserve the epithet of <em lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">clandestine</em>, will
cause a bitter feeling throughout France. Vendôme’s
sister,<a name="FNanchor_52_52" id="FNanchor_52_52"></a><a href="#Footnote_52_52" class="fnanchor">52</a> who is now of marriageable years, is intended
for Alençon, so that he will ally himself with the
Bourbons, while the King will be connected with the
Guises. As to the policy of these marriages I am
doubtful and fear that they will only add to the miseries
of France.</p>

<p>I now implore your Majesty to send back the bearer
of this letter as soon as possible with full instructions
on all points.</p>

<p>The future Queen is, if I am not mistaken, the
daughter of a sister of Count Egmont.</p>

<p>The Queen has sent for me again, and shown me
a letter from the Queen Mother, informing her of the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">52</a></span>approaching marriage of her son the King, and telling
her that the wedding is to take place next Tuesday;
she requests her to send nearly all her attendants to
wait on the new Queen.<a name="FNanchor_53_53" id="FNanchor_53_53"></a><a href="#Footnote_53_53" class="fnanchor">53</a> Accordingly, many of her
people have left, in order to oblige the King; a few
have refused to change their mistress at such short
notice. Among these last are the Comte de Fiesco
and his wife. I should be glad if your Majesty would
notice their loyal conduct in your next letter.</p>

<p>I trust your Majesty will seriously consider what
ought to be done; we must have a clear and distinct
answer.</p>

<p>Whither is the Queen, your Majesty’s daughter, to
go? It is impossible for her to remain in France
without seriously compromising her position, for here
all will attach themselves to the new Queen, and, as
usual, worship the rising sun! It is a common saying
that if one loses one’s position in life, life is not worth
the having. I will not say more, as I rely on your
Majesty’s discretion, and affection for your most loving
and obedient daughter.</p>

<p>In the first place, we must have either cash or
credit, and for that reason I am going to the Netherlands.
As soon as the messenger shall have returned
to Brussels, I shall be in a position to draw the money
from whatever house your Majesty may please to appoint,
and return with it to the Queen.</p>

<p>By this means I trust we shall be able to get away
from Paris before the King returns, or at any rate leave
soon after his arrival, and thus save our eyes and ears
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">53</a></span>from a great deal of vexation; for when changes of this
kind take place there is much that is unpleasant.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>The same day.</p></blockquote>

<p>As to the dower question, of which I wrote from
Lyons, the Queen’s advisers at Paris think that it will
be impossible to obtain a settlement on Crown lands
for the whole of the 60,000 francs per annum due to the
Queen. They say this was not done for the Queen of
Scots, though France was then much more prosperous,
and her uncle, the Cardinal,<a name="FNanchor_54_54" id="FNanchor_54_54"></a><a href="#Footnote_54_54" class="fnanchor">54</a> was absolute master of
the realm.</p>

<hr />
<h3>LETTER XV.</h3>

<p class="noindent"><span class="smcap">I have</span> now been four days in Brussels waiting for
your Majesty’s orders; I am sure your Majesty will
see how important it is that I should have them as
soon as possible. When I get them I shall return to
the Queen with all speed.</p>

<p>Her position I explained clearly in my last letter. I
have heard some remarks which make me uneasy; people
warn me that the French are most liberal in their promises,
but very niggardly in their performances, and
think the Queen will have great difficulty in obtaining
her revenues, and not receive more than half the
nominal amount. They quote the case of Queen
Leonora.<a name="FNanchor_55_55" id="FNanchor_55_55"></a><a href="#Footnote_55_55" class="fnanchor">55</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">54</a></span></p>

<p>I must say I am anxious, but I trust things will not
prove quite so bad.</p>

<p>With the end of this month the quarter will expire
during which the King is to defray the Queen’s expenses,
and she will then be left to her own resources.
I fail to see how funds are to be provided, unless your
Majesty will supply them. For, even assuming that
we should demean ourselves so far as to go begging
to the King, we should expose ourselves to be taunted
with holding out on the question of the dower as an
excuse for dipping our fingers into the King’s purse.
The only available remedy is for your Majesty to place
8,000 or 9,000 crowns to our account, and this I trust
will be done. As to the rest, I find that some people
here talk of the Queen for the governorship of the
Netherlands. I should prefer seeing the appointment
offered to one of your Majesty’s sons; still, on the supposition
that there should be an obstacle in the way of
such an arrangement—as is by no means impossible—or
in case of the Archduke’s receiving a more tempting
offer elsewhere, people have much to say as to the
advantage which the public would reap from the
Queen’s acceptance of the post.</p>

<p>Within the last few days, negotiations for peace
have been opened at Breda,<a name="FNanchor_56_56" id="FNanchor_56_56"></a><a href="#Footnote_56_56" class="fnanchor">56</a> where both parties are
represented by delegates. God grant they be successful,
as many hope and everyone wishes; wise men,
however, shake their heads, for it is certain that the
religious difficulty will prove a most serious obstacle
on account of the great number of Hollanders and
Zealanders who have publicly renounced the Catholic
religion. I fail to see how they can be induced to sell
their property and go into exile, especially as they are
for the most part sailors and fishermen, and the loss of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">55</a></span>their trade would mean to them absolute starvation.
The King, on the other hand, is determined to allow
none but Catholics to remain in his dominions. Most
people despair of a solution.</p>

<p>After writing my last letter I had some conversation
with a gentleman as to the Queen’s return; he
told me that he knew for certain that the Cardinal of
Este<a name="FNanchor_57_57" id="FNanchor_57_57"></a><a href="#Footnote_57_57" class="fnanchor">57</a> had long ago applied for the honour of escorting
the Queen to her destination. The Cardinal holds a
great deal of rich preferment: they say his income
amounts to 100,000 crowns.</p>

<p>There is now, therefore, no doubt on this score: the
King will take care that the Queen is sent to your
Majesty with every mark of honour.</p>

<hr />
<h3>LETTER XVI.</h3>

<p><span class="smcap">I returned</span> to Paris March 21, where I found the
Queen in excellent health, and delighted at the prospect
of a speedy return to her august parents.</p>

<p>I delivered your Majesty’s letter to the King, and
laid before him your Majesty’s request that the Queen
might have what was due to her under the marriage
settlements. He, as usual, gave me a kind answer, and
said he would take the opinion of his council. The
Queen Mother has also kindly offered her services on
our behalf. Still, we want deeds and not words!</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">56</a></span></p>
<p>It is quite clear that very little, if any, addition will
be made to the 32,000 francs already secured on Crown
lands. The property, even in the most prosperous
days, never produced 60,000 francs.</p>

<p>You ask whether your Majesty’s granddaughter
will be permitted to accompany her mother to Austria.
I am not sanguine, as I know of no precedent of the kind
in the history of France. The end of it will be that, when
they have exhausted their other pleas as to the length
of the journey, the delicacy of the child, and her tender
years, they will fall back on the argument that it is contrary
to all the precedents of France, and I hardly see
how we can meet it. If, however, your Majesty should
decide on making a further attempt, I would recommend
letters being sent to the King and Queen Mother,
and I myself will leave no stone unturned to forward
the arrangement; but I should advise your Majesty
simply to ask to see the child, and, if this is granted,
the situation will be reversed, and her return to France
will depend on your Majesty’s pleasure.<a name="FNanchor_58_58" id="FNanchor_58_58"></a><a href="#Footnote_58_58" class="fnanchor">58</a></p>

<p>As to affairs in this country, they were so bad that
I thought it impossible for them to grow worse; nevertheless
they <em>are</em> rapidly growing worse. Damville,
with his friends, is carrying war through Languedoc
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">57</a></span>and Guienne, and gentlemen are daily flocking to his
standard.</p>

<p>Words cannot describe how unpopular the King
and Queen have become throughout France. So
gloomy is the prospect, that careful, respectable men, I
see, are thinking of leaving the country and emigrating
to some distant land. Nevertheless, peace negotiations
are still going on, for delegates from the rebel party are
in Paris, and more are expected. They demand, I
hear, first, liberty of conscience; and, secondly, the
convening of the States General with a view to reforming
public abuses.<a name="FNanchor_59_59" id="FNanchor_59_59"></a><a href="#Footnote_59_59" class="fnanchor">59</a> This last demand is supposed to
be aimed at the Queen Mother and certain Italians of
rank who occupy high offices. But, though everything
is in a bad way, the financial situation is worst of all.
It fairly passes belief. The King borrows what he
can here and there from those who have, or are thought
to have, money; but even then he cannot get enough.
It was determined to send a large sum of money
with the ambassadors who are going to Poland—200,000
crowns, people say—but I do not believe
such a sum can be raised; they will have to be content
with much less.</p>

<p>The new Queen has been troubled with constant
sickness for several days, and some fancy she is with
child. She is no favourite with the Queen Mother,
who takes little pains to conceal her prejudice.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">58</a></span></p>
<p>The Queen, your daughter, has made up her mind
to visit Amboise<a name="FNanchor_60_60" id="FNanchor_60_60"></a><a href="#Footnote_60_60" class="fnanchor">60</a> after Easter, for the purpose of
taking farewell of her child. She is afraid to let her
travel, on account of her delicacy. She will be away
for a month or thereabouts.</p>

<p>I hope your Majesty will condescend to grant the
request which I have already preferred, and order my
half-year’s salary to be paid to Don Rodolph Khuen,<a name="FNanchor_61_61" id="FNanchor_61_61"></a><a href="#Footnote_61_61" class="fnanchor">61</a>

<h3>LETTER XVII.</h3>

<p class="noindent"><span class="smcap">Finding</span> that Count Nogarola was on the point of returning
to Vienna, I felt I must send a letter to your
Majesty, although the Queen’s business is still on hand,
and I am expecting every day to have it settled. I
shall reserve my account of this matter, and send it by
Peter the courier. Peter arrived here on the 15th of
last month, and gave me a letter from your Majesty.
On learning your Majesty’s instructions, I demanded
an audience of the King, but he was so much engaged
in the negotiations for peace that he was unable to see
<span class="pagenum2"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">59</a></span>me, and referred me to the Queen Mother and the
young Queen. By the King’s orders, I went first to
the Queen Mother. On my laying before her your
Majesty’s request, and delivering your letter, she, as
usual, spoke of the great regard she entertained towards
your Majesty, mentioning the deep obligation
under which she had been laid by your Majesty’s
attentions to her son the King. She inquired after
your Majesty’s health, asked where your Majesty was,
and whether you would shortly pay a visit to Frankfort.
I made suitable answers, and then began to ask
for her support in the Queen’s business.</p>

<p>Whilst we were thus engaged, the young Queen
(Louise de Vaudemont) entered the room, and I took
the opportunity of offering her your Majesty’s congratulations
(on her marriage). She sent her most
humble thanks to your Majesty, and made offer of her
services to the Queen with many expressions of regard.</p>

<p>After this the Queens gave me leave to go, and
two days later I had an interview with the King.
When I had laid before him your Majesty’s message,
he replied that he on his part would always be glad to
be informed of your Majesty’s views. He had married,
he said, in order to promote the interests of his subjects
and gratify their wishes. One of his inducements,
he added, for allying himself with the House of Lorraine
was its connection with your Majesty.<a name="FNanchor_62_62" id="FNanchor_62_62"></a><a href="#Footnote_62_62" class="fnanchor">62</a> For the rest,
he placed his services heartily at your Majesty’s disposal,
and concluded by asking me to let him know
when I intended sending back the courier, as he wished
him to take his answer to your Majesty’s letter. When
I mentioned the Queen’s business, he begged me to
have patience a little longer, till the negotiations which
were now going on should be concluded. He would
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">60</a></span>then place the matter in the hands of his Council, and
would himself do everything in his power for the
Queen.</p>

<p>The peace negotiations which the King alluded to
have occupied his attention for some time past, and I
hardly yet know what the result will be.</p>

<p>Everyone is anxious for peace, specially the King,
but the terms offered by the insurgents are very hard,
as your Majesty will see from the paper I enclose.</p>

<p>The extravagant nature of their demands will, in
my opinion, make it difficult for the King to grant
them. The delegates will shortly be sent back to their
friends with the King’s answer, and are to return with
their reply on St. John’s Day (June 24). Meanwhile
there seems to be a good prospect of peace; everyone
is anxious for it, and so everyone assumes that it is
certain.</p>

<p>Well, I am afraid it will be easier to <em>make</em> peace
than to <em>keep</em> it, and also I am apprehensive that peace
for the French means trouble for their neighbours, for
nothing would so calm the atmosphere in another
quarter (the Netherlands) as a tremendous storm in
France.</p>

<p>Frenchmen cannot keep quiet, and many years of
war have made them more restless than ever; consequently
it is a matter of the first importance to France
that her adventurous spirits should find a field of action
elsewhere instead of fastening on her own vitals.</p>

<p>Peace has been concluded between the King and the
Queen of England, on the same terms as before.</p>

<p>The Ambassador who returned from England brings
back a story of a joke the English Queen (Elizabeth)
made at his first audience.</p>

<p>She at once asked whether the King was married.
He replied in the affirmative, and began telling her<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">61</a></span>
who the new Queen was. Her Majesty broke in—‘Yes,
exactly; that was the first clause in the Cardinal’s
will. Dear me, what an unlucky woman I am!
What is to be my fate? I had counted on marrying
the Cardinal, and now I have only one hope left—perhaps
the Pope will consent to take me as his wife!’</p>

<p>About the 17th of last month the King’s ambassadors,
Bellegarde<a name="FNanchor_63_63" id="FNanchor_63_63"></a><a href="#Footnote_63_63" class="fnanchor">63</a> and Pibrac, set out from Paris; the
former was to go by way of Venice, and your friend
through Germany and Bohemia—at least he told
me so.</p>

<p>There are, I believe, financial reasons for Bellegarde’s
<em lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">détour</em>, as they have promised to send 200,000
crowns to Poland, and it would be easier to draw blood
from a stone than to make up such a sum just now in
France. They are said to be sending to the Pope at
Rome, the Duke of Savoy at Turin, and also to the
Venetians, to raise funds; they are supposed to be
thinking of selling the marquisate of Saluzzo for 400,000
crowns, or at any rate, pawning it; but I suspect
they will get more in the way of promises than in the
way of cash, and will carry into Poland plenty of
<em>golden</em> words, but very few <em>golden</em> coins. I think also
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">62</a></span>that the Ambassadors are intentionally lingering on the
road, in order that the Diet may be opened before
they come. They will thus be able to gain some idea
of how matters are likely to go; and, if they find that
their case is hopeless, they will not have the disgrace
of being defeated through their own shortcomings, or
lack of funds. Again, if the prospect seems hopeful,
and the Diet waits for them, they will be able to
employ the interval in sending agents before them to
prepare the way, and despatching letters full of fine
promises, which, with such aid as the lapse of time will
afford, may be expected so to soothe people’s minds
as to render the avoiding of the threatened Diet and
election (of a new King for Poland) a matter of no
great difficulty. I give this as my own explanation.</p>

<p>As I was penning these lines, news came that
Pibrac had been waylaid in the territory of Montbéliard,<a name="FNanchor_64_64" id="FNanchor_64_64"></a><a href="#Footnote_64_64" class="fnanchor">64</a>
which belongs to the Duke of Würtemberg, by
some French exiles. They killed two of his party,
and took prisoner the Ambassador himself. The governor
of Montbéliard came to the rescue, the neighbourhood
was roused, and Pibrac thus regained his
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">63</a></span>liberty; but he was in great danger, and lost his plate
and his money—some 7,000 or 8,000 crowns in all. The
King was greatly disturbed at the news, but when he
heard that Pibrac had escaped to Montbéliard, he gave
him supplies of money and a fresh equipment, telling
him to go to Soleure, in Switzerland, and there obtain
what was needful. This shows that the King has by
no means given up his hopes of Poland.</p>

<p>If I mistake not, I have before this mentioned to
your Majesty that agents had been sent to Sweden to
procure a picture of the King of Sweden’s daughter.<a name="FNanchor_65_65" id="FNanchor_65_65"></a><a href="#Footnote_65_65" class="fnanchor">65</a>
The picture has now come. Strange to say, it greatly
resembles the new Queen in height, complexion, and
features; the resemblance is increased by her having
been taken in a French dress.</p>

<p>I must not forget to add that a number of ambassadors
have come from Switzerland to take part in the
negotiations for peace as mediators.</p>

<p>It is supposed that Vaudemont, the King’s father-in-law,
will also offer his services as peacemaker. He
is expected here in the course of a few days with the
Duke of Lorraine. The reason of his coming, however,
is not connected with the negotiations for
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">64</a></span>peace, but with a wedding, the Marquis of Nomeny,
Vaudemont’s son, being about to marry the wealthy
daughter of Sebastian de Luxembourg, the Vicomte de
Martigues.<a name="FNanchor_66_66" id="FNanchor_66_66"></a><a href="#Footnote_66_66" class="fnanchor">66</a></p>

<p>May it please your Majesty, Ilsing<a name="FNanchor_67_67" id="FNanchor_67_67"></a><a href="#Footnote_67_67" class="fnanchor">67</a> has just sent
word that of the 8,000 crowns required for the Queen’s
service he has not been able to raise one farthing at
Augsburg by pledging his own credit or that of the
Ballers, and that he has therefore written to your
Majesty to inquire whether there is any merchant
about the Court who would, on their security, place
that amount to the Queen’s credit at Lyons. I am
expecting an answer from your Majesty on this matter.</p>

<p>The Queen is naturally and justifiably anxious to
see her daughter before leaving France. She has been
ready to go to her since Easter, but has been stopped
by want of funds, and will be kept waiting still longer
unless they are provided, so that I am beginning to
fear that she will have to leave without seeing her
child, to her great sorrow. But this is not the only
point to be considered, for the Queen may have many
other calls upon her purse, so that it is of the greatest
importance that she should be supplied with money, if
she is to maintain her position, live in comfort, and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">65</a></span>take advantage of such openings as may occur. I hope
it will not be long before I have more certain tidings
to give your Majesty with regard to the dower, and I
will then write at length by Peter the courier.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>Paris, May 15, 1575.</p></blockquote>

<p>I heard to-day that some one said he would lend the
Queen 10,000 crowns, to be recouped out of her revenues.
If this be so, and the money can be obtained at
a reasonable interest, I think the Queen will accept
his offer, since our business may any day take such a
turn as to render the possession of money indispensable,
if we are not to be exposed to delay and loss.
For instance, it is essential to have a valuation made
of the revenues of the places offered to the Queen, in
order to make sure that they are not passed off for
more than they are worth. Now, this valuation will
cost not less than 300 or 400 crowns, and so without
this sum we cannot conclude the negotiations. Again,
I have had notice that the King refuses to provide for
the Queen’s expenses after the Feast of St. John
(June 24), and wishes her to live at her own charges
from her own revenues, and I am afraid of their pressing
the matter in such a manner as to render refusal impossible.
For we must admit that the King, when
surrounded with difficulties himself, has done his utmost
for the Queen. It is now more than ten months
since the salaries of the Queen’s household have been
paid, and her people have received only paper cheques,
or drafts. How many of these are ever likely to be
paid, God only knows! The Queen’s servants are so
utterly destitute of money that they have often had
to undergo a hardship quite without precedent. On
some days there were not funds in the palace to provide
the table of the nobles and courtiers, and those<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">66</a></span>
who did not care to fast had to procure their own
dinner.</p>

<p>Those who understand the arrangements of the
Queen’s household declare that it would be to the
advantage of the Queen and her household for her to
live at her own charges, instead of being hampered
with the present arrangement. Bellegarde, the other
royal ambassador, who was to go through Italy, is said
to have fallen sick.</p>

<p>News has lately come to Paris that Mademoiselle

Prince of Orange; the report finds credit everywhere.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">67</a></span></p>

<h3>LETTER XX.</h3>

<p class="noindent"><span class="smcap">I sent</span> quite lately, by Peter the courier, such statements
as seemed necessary, and I think my despatches
must have already reached your Majesty.</p>

<p>I now write by order of the Queen.</p>

<p>To-day she summoned me into her presence and
told me she was quite certain from the present aspect
of affairs, and specially from the greater severity with
which Montmorency was guarded, and the circumstance
that the King was levying troops, that there was every
prospect of war, and of all the confusion that must
necessarily follow in its train.</p>

<p>She instructed me to write to your Majesty, and
urge this additional reason for expediting her journey
home. She says she has borne her position patiently as
long as she could, but she foresees that it will soon become
intolerable. I told the Queen that I would humbly
obey her orders, although I felt sure that your Majesty,
after reading my last despatches, would do all that was
possible towards forwarding her return, and that on this
account my letter would be unnecessary.</p>

<p>Having informed your Majesty of my conversation
with the Queen, I consider I have executed her commands,
and do not think any petition or prayer necessary
on my part, in order to induce your Majesty to
accede to the natural desire of your most loving
daughter.</p>

<p>If we can trust the news we hear, war is already at
our gates, and a war which holds out no prospect of
relief, but, on the contrary, will aggravate the misfortunes
and miseries of France; this is saying a great
deal, for the country is already in so bad a state that
to make it worse seemed a downright impossibility.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">68</a></span></p>

<p>But if the report be true that Condé and the other
exiles will bring strong forces to the support of their
friends, there are no bounds to the mischief that will
ensue; in that case the existence of the present <em lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">régime</em>
will hang on a thread, and be in the utmost danger;
for then the contest will be, not as to whose opinion
shall have weight in council, or who shall stand first in
honour and rank, or who shall administer the affairs of
the kingdom, but simply <em>who shall wear the crown</em>.</p>

<p>If the King should gain the day, it is easy to see
that he will stand upon his rights, and punish the rebels
as traitors; while, if the other party should prove
victorious, they will bring the King to trial for his
tyrannical conduct. He must expect no mercy or forgiveness;
he has often tried issues with them, and still
oftener broken his word, until at last none will believe
it. It is to be feared also that the flames of civil war
are likely to spread over a wider area than existing
appearances would seem to indicate; for there are
many who smother their grievances at present, though
they are disgusted with the treatment they have themselves
received and the miserable condition of the
country, and these, it is to be apprehended, will flock
to Condé’s standard. The voice of the country is undoubtedly
on his side, as all are dissatisfied with the
manner in which the government is at present conducted.</p>

<p>The case of Montmorency, to which I have alluded,
stands thus. His prospects (of regaining his liberty)
appeared to be good, and he was being treated with
much more indulgence than before, when tidings came
of his brother, Damville<a name="FNanchor_69_69" id="FNanchor_69_69"></a><a href="#Footnote_69_69" class="fnanchor">69</a>; then all of a sudden there
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">69</a></span>was a complete change, and the prison rules were made
much stricter: by the King’s orders all his servants
were removed, and, though seriously ill, he was not
allowed to keep so much as his physician or his cook,
new servants being appointed by the King. This
alteration in his treatment has caused the greatest
alarm to his mother and other relatives, for they think
that this is a first step towards taking him off by poison.</p>

<p>The King is so sure of Damville’s being dead that
he has already given away every one of his offices and
commands. He is supposed to have died of the plague
fever on the last day of last month.</p>

<p>His friends refuse to regard him as dead and console
themselves with a vague hope that he is still alive.</p>

<p>I trust that no delay or difficulty will arise with
regard to the Queen’s journey; still, if it had not been
finally settled otherwise, I am not sure that the route
by the Netherlands would not be the most convenient.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">70</a></span>In any case, that road will always be open to her,
should the others be blocked. But your Majesty will
decide what is best.</p>

<p>The Portuguese ambassador has arrived and called
yesterday on the Queen. The King was indisposed,
but is now better.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>Paris, June 13, 1575.<a name="FNanchor_70_70" id="FNanchor_70_70"></a><a href="#Footnote_70_70" class="fnanchor">70</a></p></blockquote>

<hr />
<h3><a name="xxia" id="xxia">LETTER XXI.</a></h3>

<p class="noindent"><span class="smcap">The</span> Duke of Lorraine and Vaudemont are, they say,
expected here in the course of two or three days.</p>

<p>The tedious and difficult negotiations about peace
have kept Paris in suspense for a long time. The following
appears to be the result: the deputies from the
insurgents have not been able to carry all their points,
and the King, on his part, has not succeeded in inducing
them to accept his terms. They have therefore
agreed upon a compromise, the clauses of which are to
be referred to Condé, Damville, and the confederate
towns: should they accept them, peace will be declared;
in the other case, war will be resumed. But it will be
much easier to declare war than to carry it on, as
France is terribly reduced, and the King himself is in
the greatest straits for want of money.</p>

<p>The religious question, which in the Netherlands
is the only obstacle to peace, has not been considered
here as a matter of paramount importance, and the
King has made no difficulty about granting liberty of
conscience; there were other points which were more
difficult for him to digest—to wit, that the rebels should
have possession of two cities in each province, in addition
to those which they now hold, as places of refuge
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">71</a></span>in time of trouble. They demand also that members
of their party should be admitted into the Parliaments,
and that the King should pay the wages of the German
reiters who have taken service with them; and, again,
that the States-General be convened. If this last
should be granted, the Queen Mother will be in great
danger of losing her authority. There are some other
points, which your Majesty will learn from the enclosed
paper.</p>

<p>Never did France so hunger after peace; never was
the country so unanimous in desiring it. On other
occasions it has been sometimes the Order of the
Clergy and sometimes the Order of the People, which
has been averse to a pacification; now all exclaim with
one voice that war means ruin. But the peace, I suspect,
will not last long,<a name="FNanchor_71_71" id="FNanchor_71_71"></a><a href="#Footnote_71_71" class="fnanchor">71</a> since it has been obtained by
compulsion, and granted by necessity.</p>

<p>Moreover, I have observed that the authority of
the Crown has marvellously declined; men have
shaken off their respect for the King’s name, and are
like horses who have got rid of their traces and fairly
bolted. The revolutionary spirit is rampant; some
people are extremely unpopular; feuds among the chiefs
run high—these feuds are of old standing and cemented
with the blood of slaughtered kinsmen; to settle and
arrange such differences would require much trouble,
ample time, and infinite tact. I see that some people
in a high position think that it would be to the advan<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">72</a></span>tage
of France if certain illustrious gentlemen were to
quit the country, and all the nobles who wish for war
were to find a field abroad, thereby relieving their
country of anxiety and trouble. From all this we may
safely conclude that quiet in France (if quiet be possible!)
means a great disturbance in the atmosphere
elsewhere. On this ground some—not without reason,
perhaps—remember with regret, how useful Milan<a name="FNanchor_72_72" id="FNanchor_72_72"></a><a href="#Footnote_72_72" class="fnanchor">72</a> was
as a training-school for the education of young French
soldiers, and also as a means of letting out, without
injury to the rest of the body, that bad blood of which
France has such store.</p>

<p>The nation desires Condé to be appointed to lead
a force into the Netherlands to the assistance of Orange,
for it is thought that it will be no small gain to France
if he is sent beyond the borders. Condé is himself
possessed of considerable resources, and will be well
supported by his party, who wish to see him famous
and great; they will the more readily fall in with this
plan because it will remove him from the scene of danger
and place him where he will be safe under the
shadow of that great Prince (Orange).</p>

<p>Meanwhile the Royalists will rejoice at this opportunity
of delivering France from a troublesome and
restless crew, and congratulate themselves that the
quarrel is to be fought out in the Netherlands instead
of France.</p>

<p>I must explain that nothing is so hateful to your
French gentleman as quiet and repose. He would
rather be rolling the stone of Sisyphus than keep still;
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">73</a></span>he is for ever hunting after an enterprise; he would
fain do something great; if that something be honourable,
all the better, but if there be difficulty on that
score, he is not particular; so long as it affords a field
for the display of courage and skill, and is thought
dashing, the question whether it is right or wrong is
absolutely immaterial. These are the ideas which
nature has planted in him, and example confirmed,
while long years of lawlessness and licence have made
their practice a habit.</p>

<p>Hugo de Blot, the Netherlander, is anxious to
enter your Majesty’s service; as no better post is to
be had, he has applied for the comparatively humble
position of librarian. He has asked me to recommend
him.</p>

<p>I am fully aware how little weight my word can be
expected to carry, feeling as I do that I have need to
be recommended myself instead of recommending
others; still I trust your Majesty will not be offended
at my mentioning the subject. I know De Blot to be
both a good scholar and an honest man; there are,
however, two people who will be able to give most
positive testimony as to his character—Bishop Listhius<a name="FNanchor_73_73" id="FNanchor_73_73"></a><a href="#Footnote_73_73" class="fnanchor">73</a>
and Lazarus Schwendi,<a name="FNanchor_74_74" id="FNanchor_74_74"></a><a href="#Footnote_74_74" class="fnanchor">74</a> for they both selected him to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">74</a></span>take care of their boys—he was their tutor for several
years in Italy—and if they judged him fit to take care
of their <em>boys</em> (liberos) I conclude he is quite fit to take
care of your Majesty’s <em>books</em> (libros).</p>

<p>I do not wish to press the matter further. I have
now given my testimony on behalf of an excellent
gentleman, and at the same time I feel I have done
my duty to your Majesty in introducing to your notice
a man who will fill the post admirably. Your Majesty
will now come to a decision as to the appointment,
and of the wisdom of that decision, whatever it
may be, I entertain not the slightest doubt.<a name="FNanchor_75_75" id="FNanchor_75_75"></a><a href="#Footnote_75_75" class="fnanchor">75</a></p>

<p>The Spanish Ambassador told me that the Duke of
Medina de Rio Sicco is coming hither from his Sovereign
to congratulate the King of France on his
marriage. An ambassador is also coming from Portugal
on the same errand: I believe he has been six
months on the road, although he arrived a few days
ago at Nantes, a town in Brittany.</p>

<p>The King is suffering from influenza, but is not
supposed to be in any danger. There was a report
quite lately that the Duke of Savoy had taken Savona,
but it is not believed to be true. As to Jorneton, of
whom your Majesty writes in the letter dated May 2,
your Majesty’s orders shall be obeyed.</p>

<p>Madame de Montmorency, formerly wife of the Con<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">75</a></span>stable
of France, who was then in such high estate, is
now in great misery and affliction on account of her
sons; she has earnestly besought the Queen to procure
letters from your Majesty to the King of France, asking
him to release her son, the Maréchal de Montmorency,
from his long imprisonment. The Queen
has given me instructions to write to your Majesty
about this business. I should have had some hesitation
in complying with her wishes, if any ground still existed
for the dreadful suspicions which were at first entertained
with regard to his case; but facts have now
transpired which tend to show that these suspicions
rested on little or no foundation, and people are beginning
to take a juster view; indeed, the Queen Mother
could not be kept from visiting Montmorency, and
chatted with him for some time. Under these circumstances,
I feel that I cannot do wrong in obeying the
Queen’s orders, and that your Majesty might write to
the King on the subject of Montmorency’s release in
perfect confidence that such a suggestion will not be
taken amiss in any quarter. Undoubtedly this great
and honoured lady (Madame de Montmorency) has
shown the utmost kindness and attention to the Queen
during the whole of her residence in France; she has
never failed to support her in every way, and on her
assistance, advice, and loyalty the Queen has been
always able to reckon; such services may well claim your
Majesty’s kind consideration, and this is a good opportunity
of manifesting your gratitude.</p>

<p>By adopting the course which I venture to suggest,
your Majesty will not only gratify the Queen, but will
also lay the whole House of Montmorency—which now,
indeed, is brought low, but must one day rise again—under
an obligation so great that it can never be
forgotten.</p>

<h3><a name="xxiia" id="xxiia">LETTER XXII.</a></h3>

<p class="noindent"><span class="smcap">Not</span> long ago I called upon the King of Portugal’s
Ambassador, and a few days later he returned my call.
I had a conversation with him which is perhaps of no
great importance, but it is as well that your Majesty
should hear of it.</p>

<p>He spoke of the Queen in the highest terms, and
then let fall some words of regret at the bereavement
she had undergone. Her husband, he remarked, had
died in the flower of life, and she was very young to
be a widow. On my replying that it was God’s will,
and we must accept His decrees without murmuring,
the Ambassador interrupted me with a remark that
the Queen would have great difficulty in finding a
second husband of such rank as would justify her in
marrying him, seeing that her first husband had been
a very great and powerful King.</p>

<p>Hereon I remarked that it was by no means an
unusual thing for the queens of great kings, on the
death of their husbands, to marry potentates of inferior
rank, and sometimes to take even dukes as their husbands.
I was able to quote, as an instance, Mary, the
sister of Henry VIII., King of England, who on the
death of her first husband, Louis XII., King of France,
was, at her brother’s desire, married in England to the
Duke of Suffolk. ‘Still,’ said the Ambassador, ‘if I
am any judge of looks, she is too proud to marry anyone
lower in rank than her first husband.’ Thereon I
replied, that I had good reason to know that any idea
of a second marriage was most distasteful to the Queen,
who cherished in her heart the memory of the husband
she had lost, but never could forget. Still, I observed,
she was a lady of great judgment and discretion, one<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">77</a></span>
who would, I was sure, always be willing to take her
parents’ advice and submit to their wishes. The Ambassador
expressed his appreciation of such discretion,
and we proceeded to discuss other topics, coming back
at last to the old subject, and talking of the connection
between the Houses of Austria and Portugal, which
dates from the time of the Emperor Frederic.<a name="FNanchor_76_76" id="FNanchor_76_76"></a><a href="#Footnote_76_76" class="fnanchor">76</a> He
concluded his remarks by saying that he hoped to see
the old alliance renewed by another marriage between
the two Houses.</p>

<p>By the way, I must not forget to say that just
before this he had been expressing his regret at the
Queen’s leaving France, and going so far away.</p>

<p>Whatever may be the meaning of his observations,
I see no reason for hiding them from your Majesty.</p>

<p>As to the other matters, Damville,<a name="FNanchor_77_77" id="FNanchor_77_77"></a><a href="#Footnote_77_77" class="fnanchor">77</a> who was lately
reported as dead, appears to have come to life again;
the prayers of his friends have had more weight than
those of his enemies; but, after all, it is a very common
thing in France for people to accept idle rumours
as established facts, without suspending their judgment
or giving themselves time to ascertain the truth. It is
quite certain that he was very ill, and some declare
that his symptoms indicated poison. Montmorency is
now more gently dealt with, and receives the same
treatment as he did before the rigour of his confinement
was increased.</p>

<p>The delegates of the insurgents are expected here
in the course of a few days, with the answer of their
party as to peace or war. Endless people have endless
reasons to give for expecting that the answer will
be favourable. For my own part, I should be sorry to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">78</a></span>express an opinion one way or the other; indeed, so
many changes take place, and so many rumours are
about, that I should not like to pledge myself for anything
I had not seen with my own eyes. Meanwhile
war is going on, but it does not seem to promise any
decisive result calculated to affect the issue of the
struggle. Insignificant towns and places are daily lost
or recaptured, and the most important news we have
had this long while is of a severe defeat the Swiss
received the other day in Dauphiny,<a name="FNanchor_78_78" id="FNanchor_78_78"></a><a href="#Footnote_78_78" class="fnanchor">78</a> some companies
being completely annihilated.</p>

<p>The Queen is quite well, but cannot help fretting
at the delay. She longs to return home; she is also
yearning to see her daughter; her wish, however, cannot
be gratified, as she has not funds for the journey;
indeed, she is so poor that meals are no longer served
at any table save that at which the Queen herself sits.
Rations of bread and wine are issued to the rest of her
people, and with this they have to content themselves
as best they may.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>Paris, July 7, 1575.</p></blockquote>

<p>If the King of Portugal wishes for the marriage,
and your Majesty is disposed to consent, advantage
might be taken of the opportunity now afforded of
sending the Queen straight from Paris to Portugal
without much expense.</p>

<p>I see our friends in France have not yet given up
all hope with regard to their claims on Poland, for
they are said to be sending thither 200,000 crowns,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">79</a></span>which they have borrowed from the Duke of Savoy.
He has received the marquisate of Saluzzo as security
for his advances. Pibrac, too, it is supposed, will be
able to do some good by visiting the Palatines<a name="FNanchor_79_79" id="FNanchor_79_79"></a><a href="#Footnote_79_79" class="fnanchor">79</a> one by
one, and making an appeal to them in the King’s
name.</p>

<hr />
<h3>LETTER XXIII.</h3>

<p class="noindent"><span class="smcap">It</span> is not long since I gave your Majesty an account
of my conversation with the Portuguese Ambassador,
to be taken for whatever it might be worth. I have
nothing of much importance to add, except that, a few
days after the letter was despatched, the Queen was
threatened with an illness. Fever was apprehended,
and there were some premonitory symptoms, but they
passed off without developing into anything serious.
Her physicians attributed the illness to grief and trouble
of mind. She is much distressed at the long postponement
of her visit to Amboise, on which she had set
her heart, and also, I imagine, at her detention in
France, from which she has long been panting to fly.
I hope to find on the arrival of the next courier, that
your Majesty has made such arrangements as will
relieve the Queen’s anxiety.</p>

<p>As for other news, the condition of things here is
unchanged, except that Montbrun is said to have been
taken prisoner. After cutting to pieces some companies
of Swiss, as I mentioned in a former letter, he
shortly afterwards found himself in the presence of a
concentration of Royal troops. Charging them with
more courage than discretion, he advanced too far,
could not cut his way back, and, after receiving several
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">80</a></span>wounds, was taken prisoner. This event caused great
joy here, as of all the men in arms against the King
none was considered more determined than Montbrun.
When all the rest of the party were stunned by the
slaughter of the King’s enemies on Saint Bartholomew’s
day, he came forward as the most valiant champion of
the cause; his was the first sword that was unsheathed,
and his the example that roused others to action.
Some think he will be brought to Paris. If so, his
doom, I fear, is sealed; he is too brave to be forgiven;
well for him if his wounds prove mortal, so that he
may die a soldier’s death. But he is not altogether
unavenged, for the Royalists were severely handled in
the skirmish in which he was taken prisoner.<a name="FNanchor_80_80" id="FNanchor_80_80"></a><a href="#Footnote_80_80" class="fnanchor">80</a></p>

<p>On Tuesday the marriage of the Marquis de
Nomeny was celebrated, in the presence of Vaudemont,
his father, and the Duke of Lorraine, his kinsman.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">81</a></span>There were amusements of various kinds, and a magnificent
entertainment. None of the Princes were at
the banquet, not even Alençon, the King’s brother,
who came only to the ball, and his sister did not go
even to that.<a name="FNanchor_81_81" id="FNanchor_81_81"></a><a href="#Footnote_81_81" class="fnanchor">81</a> I must not forget to mention that, when
the Guises wished to have the honour of serving the
King, the sons of the late Prince de Condé quietly
slipped in, and anticipated them. It is not the first
prize they have taken from them. It is strange that
Frenchmen cannot find a more honourable field for
rivalry.</p>

<p>People would fain believe that there are good hopes
of the peace negotiations succeeding. The King, however,
they say, after Montbrun was taken prisoner,
ordered 1,000 fresh cavalry to be raised. Why he has
done so, I cannot say, but I am quite certain of one
thing, that, if peace is made, it will not be because he
wishes for it, but because he cannot help himself.</p>

<h3>LETTER XXIV.</h3>

<p class="noindent"><span class="smcap">A gentleman</span> lately returned from Poland has assured
the King (and, for the matter of that, people here are not
scrupulous as to what they assert) that he had induced
the Poles to agree to accept a Viceroy during the
King’s absence. Pibrac’s letters, however, told a different
story; he says there are two policies by which
the crown of Poland may be kept: if the King will go
<span class="pagenum2"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">82</a></span>there himself, there is a certainty of success; and if he
will send 200,000 crowns, there is a chance of it. The
last plan will probably be tried.</p>

<p>The Portuguese Ambassador has taken a house,
and is expected to remain here for some time. One of
his suite has been sent to the King of Portugal, and is
likely to return shortly with an answer. Some people
fancy that his mission concerns your Majesty’s daughter.</p>

<p>It is now nearly six weeks since the courier left, and
our friends here keep asking when he will return, as
they want to finish the business and relieve themselves
of the burden of maintaining the Queen. There is a
notion that it will be to her advantage if her affairs are
placed under the protection of a Prince or some prominent
man; the Duc de Nevers<a name="FNanchor_82_82" id="FNanchor_82_82"></a><a href="#Footnote_82_82" class="fnanchor">82</a> is mentioned for the
office, which he would readily, I fancy, volunteer to
take. But a serious drawback to such an arrangement
is that it would probably excite the Queen Mother’s
jealousy; she would not like the notion of the Queen
being placed under the guardianship of anyone but
herself. I think, therefore, that any application to the
Duke should be made privately; a secret understanding
would be best, but as to its remaining secret, I am
doubtful. The Comte de Retz, one of the Marshals
of France, has been most kind in labouring to promote
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">83</a></span>the Queen’s interests; he has called on me at my
lodgings about her business.</p>

<p>As regards myself, your Majesty will be graciously
pleased to come to some decision. For my own part,
I think the best course your Majesty can adopt will be
to consider me a useless old soldier who has earned
his discharge, and to treat me accordingly. Still, I am
inclined to think it would not be amiss for some one to
remain here for a time. For the people who managed
the property of former Queens tell me that many
things happened after their departure which required
the presence of a good man of business on the spot;
while Queen Leonora<a name="FNanchor_83_83" id="FNanchor_83_83"></a><a href="#Footnote_83_83" class="fnanchor">83</a> was three years out of France
before the final settlement of her affairs, which was
impeded by various obstacles, could be satisfactorily
effected. I trust, of course, we shall profit by the experience
of other Queens, and so take measures to meet
many difficulties beforehand. Still, when you have a
shifty and tricky nation to deal with, it is impossible to
foresee every contingency, and emergencies may often
occur requiring the intervention of a faithful servant.
The Queen will have worthy gentlemen in France,
namely, her Chancellor, her Councillors, her Secretaries,
her Procureurs, and her Advocates, all of whom are
zealous for her interests, and to their discretion much,
I think, may be safely trusted.</p>

<p>At my request on a former occasion, your Majesty
sent me credentials, which were dated, I believe, in
February; I have not presented them yet, because I
thought it would be for the Queen’s interest if I said I
had no power to settle anything finally, for under these
circumstances they would be more careful as to what
they offered, as they could easily understand it would
be useless to expect your Majesty to accept anything
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">84</a></span>that was not fair. I should now be glad to have a
fresh copy of those credentials, as they may prove
necessary.</p>

<p>I wrote from Lyons asking your Majesty to send
some watches as presents for friends who have ere
now done us good service, and whose assistance we may
need again. I feel I should be wanting in my duty to
your Majesty, if I did not renew my request. One
might as well try to make bricks without straw as to
conduct affairs of this kind without presents.</p>

<p>We had some hopes of obtaining 10,000 crowns in
Paris, but were disappointed; there is nothing coming
in from our friends here, so we are often at a loss for
want of funds. I therefore implore your Majesty to
give this matter your serious consideration, for we have
no hope of bringing back any sum worth mentioning—indeed,
I doubt if we shall have enough for the
journey.</p>

<p>I spoke to the King and the Queen Mother, and
they assured me that they would see the Queen was
escorted to the German frontier in the most honourable
manner. Your Majesty, in return, will be graciously
pleased to inform us at the earliest moment to what
place you wish the Queen to be escorted by her French
suite, where I trust such preparations will be made as
will show the French escort that your Majesty is not
indifferent to that which concerns the Queen’s honour.
It will be well, too, that the noble ladies and maidens
attending her from motives of duty or affection should
feel that they have been well treated, for they are
sure on their return to talk about their reception. The
Queen has been long intending to go to Amboise; she
is naturally anxious to see her daughter before leaving
France, but her wish is still unaccomplished, owing to
her want of funds. When this difficulty is removed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">85</a></span>
she will start on her journey. I think she will be
away twenty-four or twenty-five days.</p>

<p>On the 23rd of last month a courier arrived with
despatches from your Majesty, from which I learnt
your Majesty’s views as to the course to be pursued
with regard to the two proposals made by the King.
By the Queen’s desire the matter was considered by
her Council. Her wisest advisers thought we ought
to accept that proposal which offered the best security,
and at the same time tended most to her honour, following
herein the principle adopted by steady fathers
of families, who make it a rule to prefer <em>good security</em>
to <em>high interest</em>. For, after all, the proposal we have
rejected would inevitably have left a large portion of
the Queen’s income subject to various contingencies
and dependent on another’s pleasure. True, it would
have been illegal to wrong the Queen, but, in the present
state of France, people think more of what they
<em>must</em> do than of what they <em>ought</em> to do. The Bishop
of Paris, indeed, continued of the same opinion, but his
opposition appeared to proceed more from prejudice
than reason.</p>

<p>When this was settled, I went to the King and
Queen, and having saluted them in the name of your
Majesty, whose letter I presented, I said that your
Majesty had hoped that the marriage contracts would
have been adhered to and fully carried out, but that,
as you understood from Monsieur de Vulcob,<a name="FNanchor_84_84" id="FNanchor_84_84"></a><a href="#Footnote_84_84" class="fnanchor">84</a> who was
at your Court, as well as from my despatches, in what
trouble and difficulty France was involved, you did
not wish to press the point, and had frankly accepted
the King’s proposals, in the hope that he would perform
his promises in a liberal spirit, so as to compensate
the Queen in some measure for the rights she had
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">86</a></span>abandoned. I said, further, that it was by your Majesty’s
advice that the Queen had chosen the proposal
which offered the larger settlement on Crown lands, as
being the nearest to the tenor of the marriage contract.
Both replied in the most gracious terms. Among
other remarks the King made in speaking of his goodwill
to your Majesty, he declared that he knew your
Majesty’s fatherly affection for him from your having,
when he was at Vienna, given him such excellent advice,
telling him to prefer mercy to severity, and to
choose peace rather than war. With these views, he
said, he quite coincided, but remarked that Kings were
not always allowed to have their own way. As to the
Queen’s departure, he said, he owed so much to your
Majesty, and France so much to the Queen, that it was
alike his duty and his pleasure to do everything he
could for her. If needful, he would provide for her
escort, not merely as far as Nancy, but whithersoever
your Majesty might wish. As, however, your Majesty
had chosen Nancy, he would take care that she should
be escorted thither in the most honourable manner at
the date appointed.</p>

<p>As for Montmorency, the King replied that he had
offered to stand his trial and prove his innocence; that
he might be able to do so was his earnest hope and
wish. But if, unhappily, Montmorency should be found
guilty, he would be compelled to act solely with a view
to the interests of his realm, and he thought your
Majesty in his position would do the same. Otherwise,
he would most gladly do whatever he could to
oblige your Majesty.</p>

<p>I concluded by asking that arbitrators might be
appointed, according to precedent, to make a valuation
of the Crown lands in the provinces which he was
assigning to the Queen. He agreed to do so, but<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">87</a></span>
asked me, as he was ignorant of such business, either
to put my request in writing or to see the Chancellor
and Councillors about it. And so I left the King.</p>

<p>I was much gratified during my interview with the
Chancellor at the warm terms in which he spoke of your
Majesty’s kindness to him when he went to Vienna,
and the great affection he professed for the Queen.
However, he appeared much surprised at our decision
with regard to the two proposals. De Morvilliers
also expressed astonishment, which has made me feel
rather suspicious of the whole business, as I think there
is something in the proposal we have accepted by which
we shall lose and the King gain; for hitherto I
have found them anything but generous, refusing to
make the smallest concession to the Queen, or the
smallest sacrifice on behalf of the King.</p>

<p>As to the state of the kingdom, there is but little
difference since I wrote last. The King has just now
assembled a body, which I can only describe as a
shadow of the States-General. He nominated six
persons from each province and city, choosing those
on whose support he thought he could best reckon,
the clergy, the <em lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">noblesse</em>, and the people being each
represented by two members. He laid before these
mock States-General the miseries of the country, and
the emptiness of the treasury, and then proceeded to
ask for a subsidy. After the Orders of the clergy and
the <em lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">noblesse</em> had given fairly satisfactory answers, the
representatives of the popular Order said ‘that they
would inform their friends of the King’s request, and
would bring back whatever answer the community at
large might decide to give. They could not do more, as
they had not been summoned to deliberate, but simply
to learn the wishes of the King.’ As the latter was
much dissatisfied with such a reply, they were at last<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">88</a></span>
induced to agree that every man should pay to the
King the price of one day’s food, and it is supposed
that in so great a country as France this will produce
a very considerable sum. They made this promise,
however, only conditionally, and subject to its ratification
by their fellows. All who spoke endeavoured to
impress upon the King that, if he did not conclude
peace, ruin was inevitable.</p>

<p>As regards the prospect of peace, matters are so
complicated and uncertain that it is difficult to judge.
There are strong reasons for desiring it: the country is
in a most miserable state, the war is most unpopular,
money is scarce, revolution is raising her head; but
again there are difficulties in the way: the terms offered
are hard, there are old grudges on either side, the
King’s word commands no confidence, the party in
power has lost its authority, and royalty its prestige.
Which way the scale will turn it is not easy to tell.
Meanwhile there is no break in the war; they are
fighting more fiercely than ever. The King has lately
ordered his troops to burn all the crops in Languedoc
within their reach, causing thereby as much loss to the
loyalists as to his enemies. There is also a report
that the King has raised new levies of cavalry, and
that Condé is coming with an army. Some of his
party tried a few days ago to surprise certain towns,
among which were Poitiers, Compiègne, Amiens, and
Besançon. From these attempts it is thought in Paris
that peace is probable. As it was agreed that each
party should retain what they actually held at the termination
of the war, this condition is supposed to be
the motive for these attempts. Further, however
much inclined for peace the King and Condé may
be, still people think that neither will treat except
sword in hand. As to the credit to be attached to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">89</a></span>
these reports, I am by no means certain, but I
think I can answer for one thing, that, if they make
peace between themselves, they will attack their neighbours,
in order to give an outlet to all those uneasy
spirits who if left at home would be a danger to the
State. Genoa seems convenient for this purpose, and
perhaps the Netherlands also; at any rate, one
hears already of speeches made by certain Princes,
who say that, if the King gives permission, they will
go to the assistance of Genoa with 1,500 gentlemen.
The journeys of the Fregosi<a name="FNanchor_85_85" id="FNanchor_85_85"></a><a href="#Footnote_85_85" class="fnanchor">85</a> and the Biragues to and
from Italy, and the unusually frequent conferences between
the Papal Legate and the King, make many
people suspect that something is brewing. Of the
rebel delegates who were expected with an answer
about peace, some have come back already, and the
others are said to be on the road, and are expected
shortly—among them Beauvois de la Nocle,<a name="FNanchor_86_86" id="FNanchor_86_86"></a><a href="#Footnote_86_86" class="fnanchor">86</a> who is
sent back by Condé. If this be so, the issue of the
negotiations will ere long be known for certain.</p>

<p>As for the affairs of the Netherlands, I do not
doubt your Majesty is fully informed of everything.
They do not, therefore, properly come within my pro<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">90</a></span>vince;
still there will be no harm in sending the following
particulars. After the taking of Buren<a name="FNanchor_87_87" id="FNanchor_87_87"></a><a href="#Footnote_87_87" class="fnanchor">87</a> the
persons appointed by the two parties separated without
effecting anything or even concluding an armistice.
The Royalists hope to finish the war by force of arms,
and are therefore prosecuting it vigorously by land;
they are also fitting out a fleet once more. Their
chances of speedy success will be considerably increased
by their obtaining a supply of small galleys,
which are independent of winds and tides. By means
of such boats Mondragon<a name="FNanchor_88_88" id="FNanchor_88_88"></a><a href="#Footnote_88_88" class="fnanchor">88</a> has ferried his troops over
to some islands, and intends to occupy others as
opportunities occur, his design being thus to cut off
Zealand from Holland, and prevent them from helping
each other. However successful the Royalists may
be, it will be a long business, and who can tell what
may happen in the interval to create fresh difficulties
for them? Of this much there is no doubt: Orange
has openly declared that, if he finds himself beaten, he
will, as a last resource, enter into negotiations with
England or France or some other power, and place a
foreign Sovereign in possession.<a name="FNanchor_89_89" id="FNanchor_89_89"></a><a href="#Footnote_89_89" class="fnanchor">89</a> In spite of this clear
declaration of his intentions, there are people who are
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">91</a></span>so confident in the present state of affairs that they take
no thought for the future. Three days ago, they say,
a gentleman came to Paris from the Governor of the
Netherlands to ask the Duke of Lorraine’s permission
for the passage through his territories of some thousands
of Spaniards and Italians, whom the King of
Spain, it appears, is sending to the Netherlands. If
this be so, there are misfortunes yet in store for that
unhappy country.</p>

<p>The King, whose natural melancholy is increased
by the troubles of the times, in order to divert his
thoughts has instituted a club, the members of which
take turns to invite him and the whole Court. At
these entertainments there is much merry-making and
dancing. The people grumble at these festivities;
they think it wrong for the King to give himself up
to revels, when the distress of the country is so great
and so wide-spread, as if the miseries of France concerned
him not, or there was nothing more he could
do to alleviate them.</p>

<p>The day after your Majesty’s letter was presented
to the King, Vaudemont paid a long visit to Montmorency;
on leaving, he said that he had little doubt
of his innocence, and would not hesitate, if bail were
wanted, to be his surety. He afterwards repeated to
several gentlemen his conversation with Montmorency.
The latter had professed to him his entire innocence.
There is no need to trouble your Majesty with an
account of what passed.</p>

<p>There is a report current that the municipality of
Paris was ready, out of love to the Queen, to defray
the yearly expenses of herself and her household, if
she would remain here. The proposal, they say, was
not actually made, because they were afraid that, if
the Queen refused, the King on hearing of it would<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">92</a></span>
lay claim to the money and employ it for his own
private purposes. Whether this story is founded on
fact or not, there is no doubt that people are constantly
saying that it will be a bad day for France when the
Queen goes away.<a name="FNanchor_90_90" id="FNanchor_90_90"></a><a href="#Footnote_90_90" class="fnanchor">90</a></p>

<p>The King’s desire to retain the Crown of Poland
will probably be a powerful motive for making peace,
as his advisers consider his chances are hopeless if
civil war continues in France. The Poles, they say,
will never believe that anything is to be got out of
people who have their hands so full at home; but if
peace is made, they may be convinced that the money
will be forthcoming, and that the King will some day
return to Poland.</p>

<p>Your Frenchman will gratify his own desires regardless
of the ruin and destruction he causes to
others; all with whom the French have been concerned
have been brought to ruin, or at any rate to
the brink of it, and this, I fear, will be the fate of
Poland and Genoa.</p>

<h3>LETTER XXV.</h3>

<p class="noindent"><span class="smcap">No</span> provision has as yet been made for the money required
for the Queen’s service, in spite of my reiterated
requests; not only were the former letters of no avail,
but the orders of your Majesty’s Chamber, which were
lately sent to Augsburg, have proved equally inefficacious.
Accordingly, we have been fooled not twice,
as the proverb says, but three or four times. Meanwhile
the Queen requires ready money for many pur<span class="pagenum2"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">93</a></span>poses,
and we can think of no plan for defraying our
necessary expenses without money, or for procuring it
without damaging our character; consequently we are
in great difficulties. I send your Majesty a list of
ladies to whom special presents ought to be made at
the Queen’s departure; they must be given, or she
will be thought to have behaved unhandsomely. The
list is long, and the expense will consequently be considerable.
Again, as the Queen is not likely, when
she leaves the country, to have a farthing remaining
out of her French allowances, funds will be required
for the expenses of her journey from Nancy to
Ratisbon, which must be paid in ready money. It
is hardly necessary for me to point out how closely
the matter concerns the honour both of your Majesty
and the Queen. As to the watches, about which I
have received no answer, I again most humbly entreat
your Majesty to send them. If we are left without
the means of acknowledging the kindnesses we have
received, your Majesty will hereafter find people disobliging
when their assistance is needed. Matters
occur every day in which the help of faithful friends is
indispensable, and there can be no doubt that these
little presents are of great use in securing such services.
I feel so certain that I am right, that I venture
once more to entreat your Majesty to send me three
or four watches of the most elegant workmanship.</p>

<p>As regards your Majesty’s desire that I should
remain in Paris, it is my duty to obey, though I feel
myself almost too old for the work. I wish, however,
to acquaint your Majesty with the fact that my expenses,
including those of the five journeys I have
made in the course of the last twelvemonth or so,
will far exceed my ordinary salary. I received from
Monsieur de Morvilliers 500 crowns on condition that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">94</a></span>
they should be repaid to Monsieur de Vulcob at
Vienna. I most humbly beseech your Majesty to
give the necessary orders accordingly, and to charge
the money to the account of my yearly salary.</p>

<p>The Queen, it appears, has still chances left her,
and your Majesty will probably have plenty of
aspirants to her hand, from whom you may choose a
new son-in-law! Duke Eric of Brunswick<a name="FNanchor_91_91" id="FNanchor_91_91"></a><a href="#Footnote_91_91" class="fnanchor">91</a> has sent
a gentleman hither with credentials, Doctor Joachim
Gotzen, to offer the Queen a share in his bed and
board. He likewise offers his portion of the Duchy of
Brunswick, such as it is, and 100,000 crowns which he
has in France, and undertakes that, if he dies without
children, his dominions and the rest of his property
shall go to the House of Austria. As the Doctor
hinted and suggested instead of using plain language,
the Queen could only make a guess at what he meant.
When he pressed for an answer, she referred him to
me. Accordingly he repeated his story to me, and
asked me to get the Queen to give him an answer in
person. I told him that her husband’s death had
been a great shock, and that any suggestion of a
second marriage, whoever the person might be, was
most distasteful to her. An answer from herself was
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">95</a></span>therefore out of the question. I added, that the Duke
could write, if he pleased, to your Majesty, whose ward
she had again become by her husband’s death, and
that he would get an answer from you. I treated him
throughout the conversation with all possible courtesy,
and contrived to satisfy him with this reply, which he
took back to his master. He only asked me that the
matter might not go further; I promised it should
remain a secret, and I also undertook at his request,
should I ever fall in with the Duke, to bear witness to
the care and loyalty with which he had discharged his
commission. The letter was written from Aachen,
and bore the following address, in the Duke’s own
handwriting, as I think, ‘De V. R. Mag<sup>d</sup> muy fiel y
leal servidor hasta à la muerte, qui sus reales manos
besa mas de cien mil vezes, El Duque Erico de
Brunswicque y Lunenburg.’</p>

<p>If matters go on as they have begun, the Palace
will be as full of dissension as the rest of France.
Every day the discords between the Princes increase,
even between those who ought to be most closely
united by the ties of blood and kindred. Alençon
cannot keep quiet: he is on the watch for an opportunity
to upset the Government, and will probably end
by attempting some notable <em lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">coup d’état</em>. Some suspect
him of even aspiring to the throne. It is all the
Queen Mother can do to keep him from throwing off
his allegiance. Not that she wishes to humiliate him,
for she is very fond of him, and anxious to advance
his interests in every way. Possibly in this she has an
eye to her own advantage, in order to gain Alençon’s
protection against his brother’s power, in case her
influence over the King should ever diminish. There
is also no love lost between Alençon and the Duke of
Guise. The former is supposed to have some secret<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">96</a></span>
understanding with the Huguenots, and people think
that he was privy to the attempts recently made on a
number of towns, in which some of his friends lost their
lives. His confidant in all his designs is his sister, who
is on bad terms with the King and the new Queen.
For the matter of that, she does not stand well with
her husband, the Duc de Vendôme; there are strange
stories about her.</p>

<hr />
<h3>LETTER XXVI.</h3>

<p class="noindent"><span class="smcap">On</span> the 18th of this month the Queen started for
Amboise. On her departure from Paris the King
accompanied her to the gates of the city, and his
brother, Vendôme, and Guise somewhat further, while
the Duke of Lorraine with the Cardinal of Este, the
Duc de Mayenne, the Duc d’Aumale, and the Marquis
de Nomeny escorted her to the village<a name="FNanchor_92_92" id="FNanchor_92_92"></a><a href="#Footnote_92_92" class="fnanchor">92</a> where she
dined. As I was sitting at table there with the Duke
of Lorraine and the Cardinal of Este, each of them
spoke much of their affection for your Majesty and
the great honour that had been done them in being
chosen, the one to escort the Queen on her journey,
and the other to receive her as his guest. The Duke
of Lorraine told me that in three or four days he was
returning home to make the necessary preparations for
the Queen’s arrival; he is also afraid of disturbances
arising in his absence, there being a very general
report in Paris that 2,000 German reiters are coming,
who are to make their way in light marching order
through Burgundy and Switzerland to join Damville,
<span class="pagenum2"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">97</a></span>and that more will shortly follow, as 8,000 have been
hired. This is the topic of general conversation, and
the military preparations which the King has been
making show that he regards the news as well-founded.</p>

<p>On the 24th of the same month we arrived at
Amboise, where I saw your Majesty’s grand-daughter.
The child is not yet quite three years old, is by no
means bad looking, though more like her father than
her mother, and is of a very merry disposition.<a name="FNanchor_93_93" id="FNanchor_93_93"></a><a href="#Footnote_93_93" class="fnanchor">93</a></p>

<p>The Queen intends to start for Nancy as soon as
possible after her return to Paris, which she hopes will
be about September 8. If it lay with me to decide,
I should prefer her not remaining more than eight or
ten days in Paris. Unfortunately this is not the case,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">98</a></span>so I can only do all in my power to hasten her departure.</p>

<h3>LETTER XXVII.</h3>

<p class="noindent"><span class="smcap">As</span> regards the affairs of this kingdom, I have not
much to tell. The report that the German reiters
are coming has made the Royalists rush to arms;
hopes of peace, however, are not altogether abandoned.
They seem to think they will make peace on more
favourable terms if they are ready for war. The
King, passing over his brother, who, according to
precedent, was entitled to that office, has appointed
Guise his Lieutenant and Commander-in-chief. He is
now raising troops in the district of Langres. It is
supposed, however, that they are neither very numerous
nor trustworthy, and that there are many among
them who would rather be vanquished than victorious.
Although the war is only just beginning, money is
already lacking to carry it on, and the King has had
recourse to a forced loan from the Princes of his Court
and the leading men of the kingdom. The Chancellor
contributed 4,000 francs; Lansac, de Morvilliers, and
several others, 3,000 a-piece; while the Constable—that
is, the Duchess Dowager of Montmorency—was
assessed at 6,000 francs, which are equivalent to 2,000
crowns. The sums so raised are said to amount to
100,000 crowns. Such are the straits to which France
is reduced.</p>

<p>Attempts, they say, have been made by the rebels
on several towns—Tours, Chartres, and many others—in
which free use was made of Alençon’s name.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">99</a></span>
Though matters have gone so far, commissioners from
the rebels for the conclusion of peace are still expected
in Paris. Besme, the German—who was the actual
murderer of Admiral Coligny—on his way back from
Spain, fell into the hands of the enemy, and is in great
danger, but Guise leaves no stone unturned in order
to liberate him.<a name="FNanchor_94_94" id="FNanchor_94_94"></a><a href="#Footnote_94_94" class="fnanchor">94</a> Montbrun’s wounds were such that
recovery was impossible, but, anxious that he should
not die, save by the hands of the executioner, they
caused him to be beheaded at Grenoble. As the
English Ambassador<a name="FNanchor_95_95" id="FNanchor_95_95"></a><a href="#Footnote_95_95" class="fnanchor">95</a> was suspected of having secret
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">100</a></span>dealings with Alençon and others, the King has requested
all the Ambassadors to quit their houses in the
faubourgs and come into the city, where it will be
easier to protect them; this, at least, is the reason
assigned. The new Queen has had an attack of
jaundice, but has been steadily improving for the last
few days. As for other news, desperate atrocities are
every day committed in Paris; murder and lust run
riot together. Even into the King’s own ante-chamber
they carry their brawls and quarrels, and
come to blows when they are all but in his presence.
No notice is taken of these outrages, and apparently
they are not regarded as offences against the King.</p>

<p>I had got to this point in my letter a few days
after the courier’s arrival in Paris, and hoped to send
him back without delay, when news of great importance
reached me, of which your Majesty must be
informed. Alençon, the King’s brother, who is eager
to upset the Government, and has long been on bad
terms with his brother, has fled from Paris. Having
arranged his plans some time before, he pretended on
the evening of September 15 to be going to certain
ladies, whom he had made a habit of visiting in order
to throw the King off his guard. He drove there in a
carriage with only two companions, one of whom he
sent back to the Palace to see what the King and
Queen Mother were doing; with the other he went
into the house. But he was no sooner inside than he
went out by a back door, got into another carriage,
which was waiting for him, and drove off to a trysting-place
not far away, where horses and companions were
waiting for him.<a name="FNanchor_96_96" id="FNanchor_96_96"></a><a href="#Footnote_96_96" class="fnanchor">96</a> Others joined them on the road, so
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">101</a></span>that before he reached Dreux, where he arrived in
twenty-four hours, travelling without intermission, he
had, it is believed, an escort of almost 200 men. Dreux
is a county forming part of his appanage, not far from
Normandy. He was admitted by the inhabitants, not
so much from any affection towards him, as because they
were taken by surprise, and not prepared to resist so
strong a party.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, the gentleman whom he had sent back
to the King returned to the house, and finding him
gone brought the news to the King. The latter at
first hoped he would return. But when time passed,
and he did not appear, suspicion became certainty,
and they knew that he had fled. Parties were despatched
to bring him back, but all in vain; he had
got some hours’ start of his pursuers and had lost no
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">102</a></span>time on the road. Moreover, some of the King’s people
had a hint that it might be dangerous to pursue the
chase too far, for they found on the road the dead
body of one of the Royal Guards, whose duty it was
to patrol that district. The man had challenged
Alençon, and asked who he was, and where he was
going. His comrade—for there were two of them—would
have shared his fate, but he had the presence
of mind, when his horse was killed by a shot,
to lie still and pretend to be dead. After this warning
the pursuers gave up the chase. It would have been
madness for them to continue it, as they knew he was
strongly escorted, while they were mere stragglers
hurrying along without any attempt at organisation,
as naturally is the case in a sudden and extemporised
pursuit. Alençon’s flight—or departure, as some may
call it—has produced a deep impression on the King
and the Queen Mother, as they foresee what a serious
addition it will make to the other calamities of France.</p>

<p>The next day the King ordered Nevers to follow
his brother with some regiments of cavalry to prevent
the towns from revolting, and to protect them against
assault. He has fixed his head-quarters at Chartres,
probably in order to cut off Alençon from the Loire,
and to prevent his penetrating into the country on the
other side of that river, where he must retreat if he
wishes to join his partisans. A few days afterwards
the Queen Mother followed, in the hope of recalling
him to his senses before he was utterly perverted by
intercourse with rebels; but she was not allowed to see
him. Indeed, her coming had the contrary effect, for
Alençon, suspecting foul play, and thinking he had
evidence of something of the kind, set out for the
Loire with his followers by a circuitous route, in order
to cross while it was still fordable by reason of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">103</a></span>
drought of last summer, and thus ensure his safety
and facilitate his junction with the King’s opponents.
Behind him came the Queen and Nevers—his mother
and his foe. The latter would have attacked him
whenever an opportunity presented itself, as was the
case at his passage of the Loire, but was forbidden by
the Queen. She was anxious to avoid an engagement
as long as possible, for any bloodshed might make war
inevitable. At last, after crossing the river, he granted
an audience to his mother. She spoke, they say, with
great ability, representing to him the disastrous condition
of the country, and reminding him that the
course he was taking would greatly aggravate existing
evils; ‘he, who was the heir presumptive to the crown,
ought to be the last man,’ she told him, ‘to split the
kingdom in two.’ The result of the interview was
that an armistice for a few days was arranged, to give
time for the delegates of the different parties to
assemble, and for peace negotiations to be opened.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, it was decided that Montmorency
should be released from prison, on giving his parole
not to leave Paris without the King’s permission.
Alençon is also said to have demanded that certain
very influential persons should be removed from Court.
Among them the Chancellor is included, and some
other councillors of the King, who, Alençon thinks, are
hostile to himself and his party.</p>

<p>But his chief motive for running away, it is supposed,
was a desire to escape from the degrading
surveillance under which he was kept; he remembered
that when his brother occupied the same position, he
possessed unbounded influence and had the revenues
of some of the richest provinces to support his rank,
while <em>he</em>, on the other hand, was granted but trifling
allowances, exercised no influence, and could scarcely<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">104</a></span>
call himself his own master.<a name="FNanchor_97_97" id="FNanchor_97_97"></a><a href="#Footnote_97_97" class="fnanchor">97</a> Charles IX. had appointed
the present King his Lieutenant, and had
entrusted him with the entire management of the war
and with the government of the country; while <em>he</em>
had been passed over in favour of Guise. It was
not likely that a young Prince, eager for adventure
and thirsting for war and glory, would patiently submit
to such treatment. Hence he was induced to take
this serious step, the consequences of which God only
knows. There is an impression that the King had
been warned by letters from several people of
Alençon’s intentions, and had resolved to place him
under closer surveillance, but the Prince escaped the
day before the one on which he was to have been
arrested.</p>

<p>On the 10th of this month news arrived here of
the defeat of the German reiters by Guise. As they
were marching into Berry to join Alençon, Guise came
upon them at the passage of the Marne and routed
the part that had crossed, their commander, Affenstein,
being killed, and Monsieur de Clervant<a name="FNanchor_98_98" id="FNanchor_98_98"></a><a href="#Footnote_98_98" class="fnanchor">98</a> taken prisoner.
Those who had not yet crossed were terrified
by the disaster, and began to treat for a surrender.
The King was consulted, and decided that their surrender
should be accepted, on condition of their not
serving against him for a year. They were left in
possession of their horses, swords, and cuirasses, and
the rest of their accoutrements, having to give up only
their standards and fire-arms, and an escort was appointed
to conduct them over the frontier. Thoré,
the son of the Constable, and many Frenchmen besides,
to the number of 200, who were with the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">105</a></span>Germans, crossed the river in the middle of the night,
and so escaped safe and sound. The Germans accuse
them of deserting them, while they retort on the
Germans that, though the safety of the army depended
on its speed, they could not be induced to leave their
baggage behind to lighten them on their march, and
declare that the disaster, in which they lost not only
their baggage but everything else, was due to their
wilfulness. They say that Guise during his pursuit
of the Germans often had the chance of plundering
this baggage-train, but that he was deterred by the
advice of an experienced general, who said that it
would delay their march, and finally compel them to
fight at a disadvantage. Be that as it may, the disgrace
of these troops is in my opinion greater than
their actual loss. Our friends in Paris are much
elated at their victory. The fate of the Frenchmen
who escaped by their speed is uncertain, for there are
plenty to pursue them. Guise, however, himself did
not come out of the encounter scot free; he received
a serious wound in the jaw from a musket ball, and
was at first considered to be in great danger; the
King, who loves him very dearly, gave him up for
lost, and was much distressed. Now, however, he is
expected to recover.</p>

<p>The day before the news of this battle arrived, the
King set Montmorency free, and restored him to his
former influential position. Accordingly, he is made
acquainted with the chief secrets of State, as he used
to be, and now, in the absence of Alençon and the
rest of the Princes of the Blood, takes precedence
next to the King. There is a notion that he, accompanied
by Cossé, will shortly join the Queen Mother
to act as a mediator. Alençon, people think, will
return to-morrow to his mother at Blois to re-open<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">106</a></span>
negotiations. To me the whole story sounds suspicious,
and, granted that he does go back there, I
think they will hardly come to terms. But supposing
they do, it is to my mind quite certain that war will
presently follow, either in the Netherlands or in Italy
with Alençon as the nominal or, perhaps, the real commander.</p>

<p>To-day news has arrived here that Thoré and his
followers after routing those who barred their passage,
have reached the Loire. He has, they say, about 400
horse, among whom are many Germans. Whether he
will be able to cross is uncertain, as a strong force has
been collected in hopes of crushing him. Two thousand
of Alençon’s cavalry with some infantry are
reported to be awaiting his arrival on the other side of
the Loire.</p>

<hr />
<h3>LETTER XXVIII.</h3>

<p class="noindent"><span class="smcap">On</span> September 12, the day the Queen returned to
Paris from Amboise, the courier arrived and delivered
to me your Majesty’s letter and instructions. On the
following day I asked an audience of the King, but
was put off till the next day. After complimenting
the King and the Queen Mother in your Majesty’s
name, I laid your request before them—namely, that
the date appointed for the Queen’s departure should
be adhered to. The King answered he would do
what he could to meet your Majesty’s views. I replied
that it was of great consequence that I should have a
definite answer to send to your Majesty, as otherwise
the ladies and gentlemen, who were to meet the Queen
at Nancy by your Majesty’s orders, might find them<span class="pagenum2"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">107</a></span>selves
in an awkward position. He agreed that the
request was reasonable, and promised to lay the matter
before the Council, and give me a definite answer on
the morrow. So passed away that day and the next,
which was the 15th of the month, the day on the evening
of which Alençon fled. I received almost the same
answer from the Queen Mother, except that she added
some further details about the expenses of the journey,
saying that the whole sum could not be paid down in
specie, but that an appropriation would be made
for pressing expenses, while for those that need not be
paid on the spot good warrants would be given. The arrangement
was not an unreasonable one, and the Queen’s
business appeared at that time to be in a fair way, but
then came Alençon’s flight, which caused a hitch.
For some days the King could not attend to me; at
last, on the 19th, in consequence of my pressing applications
for such an answer as would relieve your
Majesty from uncertainty, I was granted an audience.
The King at the beginning of our conversation requested
me to inform your Majesty of his unhappy
misfortune,—these were the very words he used—saying,
he felt confident from the relationship that
existed between your Majesty and himself, and from
the kindness he had experienced at your hands, that
you would sympathise with him. He remembered
that your Majesty had on former occasions advised
Alençon to keep clear of revolutionary designs. His
conduct was the more unjustifiable, he said, as he was
not conscious of having done anything on his part to
give him a reason for forming these projects or running
away. It was by the evil counsels of bad people that
he had been seduced from his allegiance, though on
his side he had behaved towards him like an affectionate
brother. This unexpected event prevented his<span class="pagenum2"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">108</a></span>
sending back the Queen at the time arranged, and I
must see myself the difficulties that surrounded him.
What the King said was only too true, and accordingly
I answered that I would comply with his request
and write as he wished to your Majesty, saying, ‘I felt
no doubt that your Majesty, with whom he was connected
by so many ties, would give him the warmest
sympathy in his troubles, and would gladly afford him
any assistance in your power.’ I then used such language
as I thought was likely to comfort him. As to the
Queen’s departure, I told him that your Majesty was
most anxious to have her back, and that your plans
did not admit of her prolonged absence, and asked
him, if it was impossible for her to leave at once, at
any rate to fix the earliest possible date. He said
he would consider my request, and promised to send
me an answer on the following day together with his
letter to your Majesty. At my interview with the
Queen Mother almost the same language was used on
both sides, except that I added that I thought, if the
Queen’s departure were put off much longer, your
Majesty would be obliged to consider how to bring her
home at your own expense, for you felt that a longer
separation was unbearable.</p>

<p>From that time to this I have never ceased pressing
the King every day and demanding an answer,
but my efforts have been of no avail. The truth is,
the King has given his ministers instructions to find
the funds necessary for the Queen’s journey, but this
is a very difficult matter, and, until he is sure of the
money, he cannot positively fix the date at which she
is to leave. In the mean time due attention has been
paid to all the interests of the Queen. A valuation
has been made of the Crown lands, and also of the
other property. A contract has been drawn up, and a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">109</a></span>
demand has been made that the deficiency in value of
the Crown lands assigned should be made good. For
the Duchy of Berry with the County of Le Forez, the
upper and lower parts of La Marche, and Remorantin
did not come to much above 26,000 francs, so that
nearly 6,000 were wanting to make up the sum the
King had promised. To find them was no easy task,
in consequence of the small amount of Crown lands
available, and the difficulty was increased by the
irregular and unbusinesslike conduct of certain officials
of the King, who tried to make out that the said places
had been undervalued, and wanted us, in consequence
of their own fault, to be content with 26,000 instead
of 32,000 francs. At last, after some trouble, it was
arranged that two places should be added, to be taken
from the Duchy of Bourbon—namely, the towns of
Murat and Gannat—and so a total of 32,000 francs in
Crown lands was made up, and the remaining sums
were secured as in the schedule annexed. All possible
care and discretion have been used in making these arrangements.</p>

<p>As regards the Queen’s departure, I should not
like to promise myself an answer from the King for
many days. The grant of 32,000 crowns is all very
well, but there is enormous trouble in getting them
paid down in hard cash: 20,000 of them, for which a
warrant on Rouen has been given, will begin to come
in on November 15, and this sum, I hope, may be
relied on. This leaves 12,000 to be provided; it
might have taken us a long time to procure this sum,
and we might have been obliged in consequence to
postpone the Queen’s departure, but fortunately your
Majesty’s bounty has made us independent so far; a
large sum has been remitted by the Nuremburg merchants,
and even if we have no answer from the King,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">110</a></span>
I feel confident that the Queen will be able to set out
about November 25 or 26. For I think it better to
risk our money than to lose our time, lest, in the changes
of this mortal life, something should occur to make us
regret deeply the loss of the opportunity; though I
feel no doubt that the 12,000 crowns decreed by the
King can be secured for the Queen even after she has
gone. When the day of her departure draws near, the
Queen will send a courier of her own to bring your
Majesty news of the final arrangements. In order to
relieve your Majesty’s anxiety, it has been decided not
to detain the present courier any longer; the Queen
would have sent him back some days ago if she had
not been waiting for the King’s letter to your Majesty;
he keeps promising to send it every day, but it does
not come.</p>

<p>One point with reference to the Queen’s journey
remains for consideration, and that is a serious one.
More German reiters are said to be on the point of
entering France, and there is danger of the seat of
war being transferred to Champagne and the country
through which her Majesty is to travel; so that it is
doubtful whether the road to Nancy will be safe, or,
indeed, if it will be open at all. Of course no one will
do any harm to the Queen, but it would be impossible
to answer for the safety of her French suite, and it would
not perhaps be consistent with the King’s dignity to
beg his enemies to grant them a sort of passage on
sufferance, and to place at their mercy Frenchmen of
the highest position, and ladies of exalted rank, especially
as nothing is safe from the lawlessness and insolence
of the times. As to these matters, the King can
settle nothing at present, as he does not know what
may be the state of things six weeks hence; but I see
that all the prudent and sensible men of my acquaint<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">111</a></span>ance
entertain serious doubts as to the safety of this
route. If it should happen to be closed, I doubt
if there is a more convenient way than that through
the Netherlands, by Cambrai, Valenciennes, Mons,
Namur, and thence either to Coblentz or Trier. Here,
again, we are met by a difficulty, for perhaps the Governor
of the Low Countries may not care to have
such a number of French people travelling through
these territories at the present time. This may be
obviated by the French suite being sent back from
Cambrai or Valenciennes, and by the servants whom your
Majesty will send, such as cooks, butlers, waiters, &amp;c.,
being ready to meet the Queen at either of those places.
For she is to take none of her domestic servants
beyond Nancy, as your Majesty will have graciously
understood from the list of her retinue which was
forwarded some time ago. There ought to be
some gentlemen at the head of each department; but
this whole scheme of going through the Netherlands
is full of difficulties, and is much more inconvenient
than the other. Still, if we are compelled to take it,
we must manage as best we can. I am willing to hope
for the best, and that this <em lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">détour</em> may not be necessary;
but if we are disappointed—and disappointments do
come—I should wish to be prepared for the worst, and
to have some arrangement to fall back upon, instead
of having to waste time in making out a new one from
beginning to end. I think it prudent, therefore, to
have our plans ready in case of need; and in the meantime
to sound the Governor’s disposition by letter, so
that if we cannot get through by any other road, at
any rate this way may be open to us; but the final
decision will, of course, rest with your Majesty.</p>

<p>As regards the money forwarded to the Queen from
Nuremberg by your Majesty’s order, I have hitherto<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">112</a></span>
received no letter from your Majesty; but the agent
of the merchants informed me that such and such an
amount was to be placed to the Queen’s credit, that
the time of payment was the end of October, and that
he would meanwhile collect the money; but, if there
was any need for it sooner, he would pay down part of
it. No doubt we shall soon have despatches from your
Majesty, and I shall then understand the bearings of
this business more clearly. I have also received no
answer as yet to my requests about the watches and
my own affairs. As regards the Kinsky question, I
will do as your Majesty orders, when Schomberg<a name="FNanchor_99_99" id="FNanchor_99_99"></a><a href="#Footnote_99_99" class="fnanchor">99</a> returns
from the campaign on which he is now away with
Monsieur de Guise; or, if he answers the letter I sent
him, I will inform your Majesty of his reply. I have
received from de Morvilliers, the Bishop of Orleans ... crown
pistoles on account of my yearly salary. I
most humbly beg your Majesty graciously to order
that amount to be paid to Monsieur de Vulcob in the
usual way.</p>

<hr />
<h3><a name="xxixa" id="xxixa">LETTER XXIX.</a></h3>

<p class="noindent"><span class="smcap">I sent</span> in my last letters by Peter the courier such
news as I had. Since then I received your Majesty’s
letter from Prague, dated September 4, which informed
me that arrangements had been made with a
Nuremberg merchant for remitting the money to the
Queen. The bills of exchange will, I trust, shortly
arrive. Without this money it is impossible to gua<span class="pagenum2"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">113</a></span>rantee
the Queen’s return; for, though magnificent
promises are held out to us, they are not to be relied
on in these troublous times, when the country is so
ground down with taxation. The 20,000 crowns are
thought to be certain; but there will not be much
left out of them after paying the wages of the household
and making preparations for the journey; 12,000
more are promised, a sum which would be abundantly
sufficient if we could reckon on it, but I am afraid
the prospect of its being paid is somewhat remote,
and to wait for the money would be to subject the
Queen to endless trouble and vexation, and perhaps
cause injury to her health. For her anxiety to return
to your Majesty, and to be quit of the troubles and
hurly-burly of France, is unspeakable. I hope, too,
your Majesty will remember what a dutiful and obedient
daughter she has always been, and will therefore comply
with her very reasonable request, and, now that she
has been led to count on returning, not let her after
all be disappointed. As regards the route she is to
take, I hope your Majesty will graciously give the
question your serious consideration. For here, indeed,
there are continual reports that more German reiters
are coming, and, in fact, are actually ready to march;
if this be true, there is also fear that the seat of war

the road to Lorraine.</p>

<p>The Countess of Aremberg<a name="FNanchor_100_100" id="FNanchor_100_100"></a><a href="#Footnote_100_100" class="fnanchor">100</a> has written from
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">114</a></span>Nancy to inform the Queen of her arrival there, and
also to inquire what she wishes her to do, and what
hope there may be of her soon leaving. She tells her
that she has been away for some time, and is much
wanted at home, but will postpone everything if she
can be of any use. The Queen replied that there was
not much hope of her leaving before November 25;
she might, therefore, revisit her home in the meantime,
provided that she presented herself at Nancy by that
day to give the Queen the advantage of her society
and company on the journey, according to your Majesty’s
desire. To prevent her making any mistake
about the day, she would later on send a letter to
inform her fully of the intended arrangements. It
will, I think, take the Countess six or, at the utmost,
seven days to travel from Nancy to her home.</p>

<p>As for other news, the state of affairs here is much
the same as it was; what little alteration there has been
is for the worse, as Alençon’s last move has made
people less hopeful as to peace. Till lately he appeared
to approve of Blois as a safe place for holding the
negotiations, but he is now said to have changed his
mind, and to demand Poitiers, his reason being that
none of the King’s opponents will trust themselves at
Blois, as it is too near Paris and they are afraid of foul
play. There is a notion that his real motive is not
peace, but to obtain possession of a strongly fortified
town. Time will show. Montmorency, to whom
everybody’s thoughts are turned as the best mediator
between the opposing parties, set out a few days ago
for Alençon’s quarters. When he started from Paris
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">115</a></span>he was escorted by a multitude of gentlemen and
courtiers. He is indeed a remarkable instance of fortune’s
changes, for only recently he was in great danger
and so hated and despised by everyone that his strong
prison-walls seemed scarcely able to protect him from
the violence and insults of the mob and his enemies.
His brother, Thoré, with his troops, has got safe to
Alençon, after routing at various places those who tried
to oppose his march, and taking prisoners some who
pursued him too eagerly.</p>

<p>As to your Majesty’s gracious answer about the
watches, it is my duty to be most humbly satisfied with
whatever meets with your Majesty’s approbation.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>Paris, October 23, 1575.</p></blockquote>

<p>I must also humbly beseech your Majesty to give
us betimes any directions about the Queen’s departure
and her journey, otherwise we may be greatly inconvenienced
by having to alter our plans at the last
moment. I shall endeavour to adhere to the arrangements
already mentioned, and intend to use my utmost
efforts to have the Queen’s preparations for the journey
completed by November 25. Accordingly, I mean about
November 20 to send your Majesty tidings by a private
courier. He will hardly reach your Majesty
before the 27th. Again, some time will be required
in order to apprise those who are to escort the Queen
of your Majesty’s wishes, and to enable them to reach
Nancy. I must therefore ask the Queen to postpone
her departure to December 1, so as to arrive at Nancy
about the 10th or 11th of the same month. I send
these details in the hope that your Majesty will be
graciously pleased to correct any mistake I may have
made.</p>

<h3>LETTER XXX.</h3>

<p class="noindent"><span class="smcap">On</span> the night before November 1, Louis du Guast was
murdered in his bed; he was stabbed in several places.
The gates of Paris were kept shut all the next day,
and search was made for the murderers, but they could
not be found. The King’s brother Alençon is supposed
to have instigated the murder, or at any rate to
have been privy to it, as he hated du Guast as much
as the King loved him.<a name="FNanchor_101_101" id="FNanchor_101_101"></a><a href="#Footnote_101_101" class="fnanchor">101</a> The cause of their respective
<span class="pagenum2"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">117</a></span>hatred and affection was but trifling; still, for that very
reason it ought, I think, to be mentioned. Some years
ago Thoré, the Constable’s son, had been playing
tennis with du Guast, and had lost a considerable sum
to him; on du Guast’s pressing for payment Thoré
kept putting him off and making excuses. Du Guast
finally lost his temper, took some horses out of Thoré’s
stable, sold them by auction and paid himself out of
the proceeds. When this came to Thoré’s knowledge,
he was exceedingly annoyed, and quarrelled with du
Guast, and ere long they came to blows. The King,
who was then Duke of Anjou (for the late King was
still alive), being informed of this, and fearing that du
<span class="pagenum2"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">118</a></span>Guast, who was his servant, would get the worst of it,
as Thoré was the more powerful man of the two,
turned out with his guards to defend his <em lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">protégé</em>. At
the same time word was brought to Alençon that
Thoré was in great danger, as Anjou had come to
du Guast’s assistance. Thereupon he immediately
brought up his escort to defend his friend Thoré. A
disgraceful contest seemed inevitable, but the Swiss
behaved with great discretion, and at last they parted
without bloodshed.</p>

<p>However, from that day forth the brothers have
been at variance, and the King has hated Thoré and
the whole house of Montmorency. Du Guast, on the
other hand, has always had Alençon for his foe.
Moreover, from his reliance on the King’s favour he
gave himself the habit of flouting Alençon and speaking
of him in disrespectful terms. His impertinence
has now cost him dear.</p>

<p>This du Guast had been appointed by the King
commander of the ten regiments of Frenchmen which
he had established after the model of the Prætorian
guard. Among them were many picked privates, serjeants,
and captains, who seldom left du Guast’s side,
and generally messed at his house at the King’s expense.
Such was the splendour and sumptuousness of
his table that if any of the Princes, such as the Duke
of Guise, or the titular King of Navarre, chose to drop
in upon him unexpectedly, they never had any reason
to regret it. Du Guast was enabled to live in this
magnificent style by the King’s generosity, for it is
certain that since he returned from Poland he has
paid him more than 50,000 crowns for his expenses. He,
on the other hand, thought it a point of honour not to
be outdone by the King in generosity, and out of this
vast sum laid by nothing for himself, as is sufficiently<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">119</a></span>
proved by his debts, which amount to 30,000 crowns.
The King has taken his murder much to heart, and
there is reason to fear it may serve as a torch and
make the war between the two brothers blaze up more
furiously than ever.</p>

<h3>LETTER XXXI.</h3>

<p class="noindent"><span class="smcap">On</span> the 24th of last month, Laurence Scuter arrived,
and delivered to me your Majesty’s two letters, from
one of which I learn that your Majesty is anxious
for definite information with regard to the Queen’s departure,
while in the other your Majesty graciously
advises me of the bill of exchange drawn on Nuremberg.</p>

<p>As to the Queen’s departure, it has till now depended
so entirely on other people’s pleasure, and the
issue of events on which it was impossible to reckon,
that I could not write with any certainty, either in the
letter which I sent by Peter the courier, or in that
which I despatched a little later by Mola of Augsburg.
But now everything is settled, and your Majesty will
find in the enclosed paper a full account of the arrangements
connected with the Queen’s return.</p>

<p>The only points on which I am still troubled are
the weather and the dangers of the road. Her Majesty
will, I fear, find it a very bad time of year for travelling,
and I am also afraid that our best and shortest
route will be rendered impassable by the presence of
the new levies of German reiters. I trust I shall soon
receive full instructions from your Majesty.</p>

<p>The Queen has decided to send off the messenger<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">120</a></span>
without further delay, for fear your Majesty should, as
on a former occasion, be kept waiting for her answer.
She will therefore despatch a second messenger,
as soon as the date of her departure is absolutely
certain, to bring word to your Majesty and at the same
time to give notice to Ilsing,<a name="FNanchor_102_102" id="FNanchor_102_102"></a><a href="#Footnote_102_102" class="fnanchor">102</a> in order that he may
write to the ladies and gentlemen whom your Majesty
has commanded to wait on the Queen. By this arrangement
I hope we shall be able to save several days.</p>

<p>I will now give some account of affairs in France.
A few days ago Alençon, the King’s brother, took
possession of Châtelherault,<a name="FNanchor_103_103" id="FNanchor_103_103"></a><a href="#Footnote_103_103" class="fnanchor">103</a> a town near Poitiers, with
the free consent of the inhabitants. The Queen
Mother is endeavouring to arrange with him for a six
months’ truce; but he demands, as a guarantee of his
personal safety, the possession of four most important
towns—Bourges the capital of Berry, Angers, Angoulesme,
and La Charité—and I hardly think the King
will consent to such hard terms, as they will be difficult
places to retake, supposing the negotiations for
peace to prove a failure. It is evident the Queen
Mother will do her very utmost to prevent her sons
from fighting, but whether she will be able to stop
them is more than I can say.</p>

<p>The Duke of Guise has come back from the wars.<a name="FNanchor_104_104" id="FNanchor_104_104"></a><a href="#Footnote_104_104" class="fnanchor">104</a>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">121</a></span>He arrived at Paris the day before yesterday; crowds
went out to meet him, and everyone congratulated
him warmly on his success. His wound is not as yet
perfectly healed, but it is no longer considered dangerous.</p>

<p>Michel<a name="FNanchor_105_105" id="FNanchor_105_105"></a><a href="#Footnote_105_105" class="fnanchor">105</a> has come to Paris as ambassador for the
Republic of Venice. Your Majesty must occasionally
have seen him, as he was for many years residing at
Vienna. The King treats him with the highest distinction,
entertaining him splendidly, and causing him
to be served as if he were some Royal personage. For
his expenses are assigned 800 francs per diem. He
has come to congratulate the King on his marriage.
He called on me lately, and spoke at great length of
the profound respect and regard which he entertained
for your Majesty.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">122</a></span></p>
<p>I hear that the Pope has offered the King 3000
Swiss to assist him in the war, which is now imminent,
against his brother and the Huguenots.</p>

<p>Pibrac’s relations tell me that they have been expecting
to hear from him for some time past, and, as
he has not written, they think he must be on the road
home. In his former letters he had given them to
understand with tolerable plainness that he had little
or no hope of success, and had therefore resolved to
take the very first opportunity of quitting Poland.</p>

<p>He felt sure that, if he remained in the country,
some affront would be put on him, not by members of
the opposite party, but by his own friends. The latter
were not well treated when their influence was used to
dissolve the Diet, Pibrac being unable to keep his
promises to them on account of the failure of those on
whom he relied.</p>

<p>De Morvilliers has ordered 500 crowns to be paid
to me; I humbly beseech your Majesty to order that
amount to be paid as usual to Monsieur de Vulcob.</p>

<p>Paris, November 9, 1575.</p></blockquote>

<hr />
<h3><a name="xxxiia" id="xxxiia">LETTER XXXII.</a></h3>

<p class="noindent"><span class="smcap">After</span> sending several times to Rouen to demand the
money for the Queen’s expenses during her journey, it
was only yesterday that news arrived of the payment
of the last instalment. With these tidings came also
an answer to the Queen from the Queen Mother, expressing
her regret at being prevented by business of
the greatest importance from going to Paris and
bidding the Queen farewell in person before she left.
After reading these letters the Queen came to the<span class="pagenum2"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">123</a></span>
conclusion that she was now at liberty to arrange a
day for starting on her journey. December 4 was appointed,
with the approval of the King, whom I
thought it advisable to consult; in giving his sanction
he expressed much sorrow at the Queen’s departure
being so near, saying he wished he could have kept
her longer in Paris, as he had no doubt that her
presence had saved the realm of France from many
a misfortune, and was afraid that her departure would
be the signal for fresh calamities.</p>

<p>The Queen thought that, as soon as it was definitely
settled, she ought to give your Majesty the earliest
possible information as to the date of her departure.
Hitherto she has been afraid to write positively, on
account of the doubts and uncertainties with which we
have been surrounded, especially with regard to money,
lest some difficulty should arise which would prevent
her from keeping her appointment with those who are
to meet her at Nancy. Now, however, there is nothing
to prevent her leaving on the day appointed, our funds
being sufficient for the expenses of the journey as far
as Nancy. There is a prospect, if we are willing to
wait, of our raising more money, but for this we shall
have to give a charge on the Queen’s future income;
to the King, moreover, who is in great distress for
money, this arrangement would involve serious difficulties,
while it would be no great benefit to the Queen,
as her departure must in that case certainly be postponed,
and it is by no means certain that she would
after all obtain the money, so that the funds provided
by your Majesty have come in the nick of time to
relieve us of our difficulties.</p>

<p>Though matters are thus far arranged, I do not
think that the Queen can reach Nancy before December
18 or 19, and I am not at all sure that she will<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">124</a></span>
not be kept there for several days, if the report be
true that preparations are being made for the marriage
of the Duke of Lorraine’s sister to the Duke of Brunswick,
in which case the ceremony will probably take
place about that date.</p>

<p>I have instructed the bearer of this letter to give
notice of the date of the Queen’s departure to the
Duke of Lorraine at Nancy, the Bishop of Strasburg<a name="FNanchor_106_106" id="FNanchor_106_106"></a><a href="#Footnote_106_106" class="fnanchor">106</a>
at Saverne in Alsace, and Ilsing at Augsburg.</p>

<p>The Queen sent forward part of her furniture
eight days ago, and also four waggons of Orleans
wine, which she thought would be beneficial in the
present state of your Majesty’s health, in order that,
if she should not reach the Danube herself before it
was frozen, at any rate her luggage might be able to
go by water. With the baggage train were sent
some greyhounds, and also a couple of lime-hounds,<a name="FNanchor_107_107" id="FNanchor_107_107"></a><a href="#Footnote_107_107" class="fnanchor">107</a>
under the charge of a young gentleman and two servants,
who accompany them by the orders of the
King. This young gentleman is a skilful huntsman,
and it is hoped that your Majesty will be diverted at
hearing him blow his horn, and cheer on his dogs in
the French fashion.</p>

<p>As to John Kinsky’s business, I applied to Schomberg.<a name="FNanchor_108_108" id="FNanchor_108_108"></a><a href="#Footnote_108_108" class="fnanchor">108</a>
He maintains that he does not owe Kinsky a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">125</a></span>farthing; he admits that he was in his debt at one
time, but declares he paid the money over some time
ago to certain parties by Kinsky’s directions, and
maintains that it is no affair of his if the aforesaid
parties have failed to make good the sum which they
received. In proof of his assertion he brings forward
the fact that the bond he gave to Kinsky has been
returned. I asked him whether he could produce
a genuine letter from Kinsky directing him to pay the
money to the parties he had mentioned. He told me
‘he did not remember: he generally tore up letters of
this kind; but still it was possible that he might have it—at
any rate, he was quite sure that Kinsky had given
him distinct verbal directions to that effect.’ He next
proceeded to abuse Kinsky for thus maligning him,
and accused him of trying to take away his character,
threatening to make him pay for it if he continued to
libel him. I asked him to give me in writing the
statements he had made, that I might send them to
your Majesty. He agreed to do so, but has not kept
his promise: I cannot say whether he failed through
want of time or want of will, for two days later the
King sent him out of Paris, and whither he went I
cannot say.</p>

<p>The names of those who are to escort the Queen
back I am unable to ascertain, for nearly every day
there is a change of circumstances, and a corresponding
change is made in the list. However, the appoint<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">126</a></span>ment
of the Cardinal d’Este is certain. Those who
are also named are the Duke of Mayenne, the Bishop
of Paris, Monsieur de Luxembourg, and some
others; but whether they will come with us or not,
after all, is, to my mind, by no means certain. As to
the ladies whom I mentioned in a former letter, no
change has been made; but some think that the
Comtesse de Retz will be added to the number.</p>

<p>Pibrac returned from Poland three days ago, after
making his way through the Hanse towns and the
Netherlands.</p>

<p>The Comtesse d’Aremberg has been given notice
of the time when the Queen is to start.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>Paris, November 9, 1575.</p></blockquote>

<p class="tb">The Queen Mother has at last succeeded in concluding
a truce for six months on the terms of the King’s
surrendering to his brother (Alençon) certain cities as
a guarantee for his safety, viz., Bourges, Angoulesme,
Mézières, Niort, La Charité, and Saumur. At the
last two towns there are bridges over the Loire, so
that Alençon can march, when it pleases him, either
into Burgundy or into Brittany; Niort opens communication
for him with Rochelle, while Angoulesme
connects him with the insurgent forces, and is moreover
strongly fortified, as also is Bourges, the chief
town of Berry. But he has not obtained possession
of more than two of these places, viz., Niort and
Saumur, the other towns are up in arms and will not
consent to the transfer, from a fear that the most
frightful calamities are in store for them if Alençon
should become their master, especially in the event of
the peace negotiations proving a failure. Accordingly,
they are preparing to do battle, and are supposed to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">127</a></span>
have entered into alliance with other towns, Orleans
to wit and Moulins.</p>

<p>The Queen Mother is said to be thinking of visiting
them in the hope that her presence will recall them
to their obedience. Whether she will succeed or not
I cannot say.</p>

<p>Meanwhile the truce is publicly proclaimed in Paris;
but, nevertheless, on the other side, German reiters
are said to have crossed the Rhine, and to be marching
into the interior, and this makes many people think
that no reliance can be placed on the truce. The
King, indeed, has also undertaken to pay Casimir and
the soldiers under his command 500,000 francs to go
off home without causing further trouble. Not having
sufficient funds for this purpose, he has sent jewels of
great value to the Duke of Lorraine, who is to retain
them as a pledge, and then become security to Casimir
for the payment of the money. The Duke, however,
has the option of taking some neighbouring town in
pawn instead of the jewels. I am afraid it is easier to
call in German horse than to send them back; and,
even if they leave France, there is fear of their pouring
into the Netherlands.</p>

<p>Mézières was appointed as the residence of the
Prince of Condé, and the King has also undertaken to
pay 2,000 infantry who are to form Alençon’s garrisons
in the towns already mentioned. But the chief difficulty
that is likely to occur with regard to the truce is
Condé’s promise to pay certain sums to the German
horse for crossing the Rhine; such at least is the story,
and the King, if he wishes for peace, will have to make
good the money. However that may be, they say that
Condé and Casimir have entered into a covenant to
help each other in case of war; and just as Casimir
came to the aid of Condé, so hereafter, should need<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">128</a></span>
require, Condé will lead his party to the assistance of
Casimir. If this report is correct, it is a matter deserving
serious consideration. In any case, the truce
has been made after such a fashion as to render it quite
plain that the King consented to it not of his own free
will, but by compulsion.</p>

<p>What would it have availed him to nurse his wrath,
and make plans for some mighty undertaking, for the
accomplishment of which his resources are totally inadequate,
when the only result would be to make his
weakness plain and risk his crown? Being utterly
unprepared, the only other course open to him was to
submit to whatever terms his adversaries thought fit to
impose, and this latter alternative he chose.</p>

<h3>LETTER XXXIII.</h3>

<p class="noindent"><span class="smcap">The</span> Queen reached the town of Dormans six days
after her departure from Paris, and there she met the
courier with your Majesty’s despatches; from which I
learnt your Majesty’s pleasure with regard to the arrangements
connected with the Queen’s journey, which
I will do my utmost to carry out. With reference to
your Majesty’s desire that I should attend the Queen
to Vienna, and act on the journey as her chief chamberlain,
I beg to offer my most humble thanks for the
honour thus conferred.</p>

<p>The Queen left Paris on the 5th of this month,
amid the tears and regrets of the entire population.<a name="FNanchor_109_109" id="FNanchor_109_109"></a><a href="#Footnote_109_109" class="fnanchor">109</a>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">129</a></span>Great sorrow was also shown by the upper classes, who
are deeply attached to her. On the 19th she reached
Nancy. Our journey was not unattended with danger,
for parties of German reiters were scouring the
country; but our party was not molested in any way.
The Duke of Lorraine, with his Court, came as far
as the first milestone to meet her, and received her
with every mark of honour.</p>

<p>That same evening was celebrated the marriage of
Eric, Duke of Brunswick, to Dorothea, sister of Lorraine.
The Queen was present at the ceremony, but
did not appear at the banquet and other festivities. On
the next day Count von Schwartzenberg came to the
Queen with a small party of Austrian noblemen.<a name="FNanchor_110_110" id="FNanchor_110_110"></a><a href="#Footnote_110_110" class="fnanchor">110</a>
Schwendi would have accompanied them if he had not
been confined to his house by sickness; however, he
has written, promising to meet us on the road if his
health permits. On the 22nd, William, Duke of Bavaria,
and his wife, arrived. The Bishop of Strasburg
has not yet come, and from his letter which Schwendi
sent me I am inclined to think that he has been kept at
home through fear of the German reiters and Swiss infantry,
whose road to Nancy lies through his territory.</p>

<p>Having heard nothing of Madame d’Aremberg’s
coming, on the day after our arrival the Queen decided
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">130</a></span>to send a courier to her; he found her at home, waiting
for the Queen’s summons. This misunderstanding was
the result of an unlucky accident. Madame d’Aremberg
had written to the Queen at Paris asking for information
as to her plans and movements; the Queen
sent back the answer by Madame d’Aremberg’s own
messenger, who promised to deliver it to his mistress
within three days. After all, the Queen’s reply, informing
Madame d’Aremberg of the date of her departure
from Paris, and telling her what she wanted her
to do, was lost, and never reached its destination. This
accident caused some delay in the arrival of Madame
d’Aremberg, but the Queen’s courier brought back a
letter from her, informing her that she would be here
to-morrow; she will require one day’s rest, so I
think the Queen will fix on Friday, the 30th of this
month, for her departure. The Master of the Order
of St. John has not come, and, as I understand, is not
expected. The whole country side is kept in a state
of alarm by wandering parties of horse and foot-soldiers.
It was on this account that the Cardinal d’Este had to
leave us in the middle of our journey and return to
Paris; he received a letter from the King informing
him that he had discovered a plot to waylay him on the
road. The Bishop of Paris has had a similar scare,
and early last night he set off home post haste under
the escort of a strong body of dragoons. Some others
who are not safe in the neighbourhood of the (German)
troops will be compelled to slip off as best they may.
The rest, who have no special cause for fear, and are
furnished with passports from Casimir, will leave Nancy
openly.</p>

<p>Three days ago Casimir sent one of the chief officers
of his household, whose name, if I mistake not, is Diest
von Sterckenburg, to congratulate the Queen on her ar<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">131</a></span>rival,
and tender his services; he was also instructed to
offer some explanations and apologies for the course his
master had taken, as your Majesty will learn at greater
length from the Queen’s own letter, for Casimir wished
her to represent the case herself, in the hope that your
Majesty would be induced to take a favourable view of
his conduct.</p>

<p>As I write this letter, bands of reiters are to be
seen from the ramparts marching past Nancy in the
direction of St. Nicolas, on their way to the town
of Luneville. The Queen will have to pass through
both these places, but the troops will have moved on
before our party starts, and the only inconvenience
we shall suffer from their presence will be the rise
they will cause in the price of provisions; nor is even
this slight disadvantage without its compensation, for
this movement will leave the road open for Madame
d’Aremberg, which she could not hitherto have traversed
without danger. As to the destination of these
armaments, and what is to be the upshot of it all, it is
not easy to say. The King indeed is treating for a
truce, and Alençon does not seem unwilling to come
to terms, but Condé and Casimir, while quite prepared
to conclude a peace, will not hear of a truce; they say
that, if they throw away this opportunity, it will not be
in their power to reassemble their forces, so that they
are in a very different position from the King, who can
raise a fresh army whenever he pleases, and therefore
finds his advantage in a truce. Casimir also demands
a large sum in addition to the 500,000 francs already
offered him by the King for the withdrawal of his
army, in order to make up the arrears of pay due to
his troops for their services in former campaigns when
fighting for the insurgents. From this we may conclude
that nothing is yet settled.</p>

<p>Pibrac, whose return from Poland I mentioned
before, is wont to say, when talking privately, that the
only advantage the Poles have gained from their
friendship with France is to catch the diseases which
are ruining the country—dissension and civil war.</p>

<p>As to other matters, the Queen is in excellent
health, and is supported under all the troubles and
fatigue which such travelling involves, by one hope
alone, to wit, the prospect of shortly being with your

<h3>LETTER XXXIV.</h3>

<p class="noindent"><span class="smcap">Yesterday</span> the Queen arrived at Bâle, where we are
now staying; to-morrow she will leave it, and in four
days we hope to reach Schaffhausen. As to what is to
be her next destination, and what road she is to take
to get there, those who have charge of these arrangements
have not, I see, quite decided, but the question
will be considered after we have reached Schaffhausen.
I understand that we are not to go through Villingen,
and, whatever haste we make, I do not imagine that we
can get to Munich before the 27th or 28th of this month.
The Bishop of Strasburg will return home to-morrow.
I judged it well to write these particulars on the chance
of my being able to forward my letter to your Majesty,
although I cannot be certain of finding a bearer.</p>

<h3>LETTER XXXV.</h3>

<p class="noindent"><span class="smcap">The</span> Queen arrived at Augsburg, January 27, and on
the same day the courier brought back letters from
your Majesty, from which I learnt your Majesty’s
gracious pleasure with regard to the Queen’s movements,
to wit, that she should come to Vienna by the
shortest and most convenient route. I reported this
to her Serene Highness, and she, being eager to hasten
on and join your Majesty at the earliest moment possible,
was in favour of a voyage down the Danube, as
this is supposed to be a good time for sailing. I then
referred the matter to William, Duke of Bavaria, and
Count von Schwartzenberg, and they judged it advis<span class="pagenum2"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">134</a></span>able
to keep the courier until they should have laid all
the considerations before the elder Duke of Bavaria,
and ascertained his views as to the relative advantages
of the water route and that by land. In order to prevent
delay, Duke William sent his own courier forward
to Munich, that the whole question might be discussed
and settled before the arrival of the Queen. Her
Highness arrived at Munich January 29. Duke Ferdinand
with the Margrave of Baden met her at a
considerable distance from the city; they were attended
by a large force of cavalry, handsomely equipped, so
that the Queen entered Munich in great state. The
elder Duke’s health was such as to prevent his going
out of doors to receive the Queen; he takes all the
expenses of her Highness and her retinue on himself,
and will not allow them to be at charges for anything;
such a liberal reception makes it incumbent on the
Queen not to stay too long. The elder Duke, on
being consulted as to the Queen’s route, was in favour
of the river, and said he would take boat himself if
he wanted to go down to Vienna; his opinion therefore
coincided with the Queen’s. She was eager to
leave on Friday, February 3, after a visit of four days,
but as the Duke pressed her to stay six days she
decided not to refuse his earnest request, and so February
6 was appointed for her departure. It will
take two days to get to Wasserburg, and then seven
more to reach Vienna, so that, unless something unforeseen
should occur, I trust the Queen will reach
Vienna on the afternoon of February 13. God grant
that we may be prospered in our voyage, as we have
been on the road; hitherto, in spite of some changes
and chances on the way, we have had a good journey,
considering the time of the year.</p>

<p>The Queen herself has enjoyed excellent health<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">135</a></span>
throughout, save that on the day she stopped at Bâle
she was troubled with violent sickness; this, however,
served to relieve her stomach, and she has since been
perfectly well. William, Duke of Bavaria, and his
wife treated her with the utmost kindness and consideration,
so that she had no need of anyone else.
The Bishop of Strasburg remained at Bâle.</p>

<p>The noblemen who came to meet the Queen at
Nancy attended her as far as Ulm, where others took
their place and have waited on her till now; they will,
however, stop here, or at any rate not follow her
further than Wasserburg.</p>

<p>Your Majesty being thus informed of the Queen’s
route, will now decide as to any further arrangements
that may be necessary. Your Majesty, of course,
knows best, but still I venture to observe that, as the
Queen has settled to go by water, a large body of
attendants is in no way necessary.</p>

<p>Munich, January 31, 1576.</p></blockquote>

<p class="tb">The time for our voyage has been lengthened by
two days, as your Majesty will see from the enclosed
route, so that, I think, the Queen will not be at Vienna
before February 15; I have also made out a list, as
best I could, of the Queen’s servants and attendants,
which I thought would be useful in arranging for their
lodgings.</p>

the same route I sent to your Majesty, with a list of
the places at which we intended stopping, and the
dates on which we were to be expected. He will,
therefore, now be in a position to make the necessary
arrangements. I have no fresh news to give of the
Queen, except that she is looking forward with great
longing to the 6th of this month, when she will commence
the last stage of her long journey and be hurrying
onward to her father’s arms. I asked her if she

<h3><a name="xxxviia" id="xxxviia">LETTER XXXVII.</a></h3>

<p class="noindent"><span class="smcap">Your</span> Majesty’s letter, dated February 4, reached me
at the Monastery of Ebersberg on the 7th, just as the
Queen was about to enter her carriage on her way to
Wasserburg. I lost no time in communicating its
contents to the illustrious Duke of Bavaria, and Count
von Schwartzenberg, and they promised to reconsider
the whole question of the route when they got to
Wasserburg. Accordingly, when we arrived, they
took counsel with the captain of the boat, but could
not prevail on him to alter his opinion. ‘He would
do what he could,’ he said, ‘to reach Vienna earlier,
but the days were so short, the water was so low, and
the mornings were so dark, that it was impossible to
promise more.’ However, I am in great hopes that
the Queen will be able to reach home one or two days
earlier than was arranged.</p>

<p>The reason I did not mention in my former letter
that the Duke of Bavaria and his wife were coming,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">138</a></span>was that I assumed that he would obey your Majesty’s
commands, as he has always professed to do. But
had it been otherwise, and had some alteration been
made so as to deviate from your Majesty’s instructions,
I should have lost no time in communicating the fact.
Under present circumstances, no change having been
made, I did not consider it necessary to write on the
subject; moreover, I believed the Duke had enclosed a
letter to your Majesty in the packet which he gave
me to forward to Vienna, containing, I did not doubt,
some reference to his coming; lastly, I thought it
probable that a <em lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">maréchal de logis</em> would be sent on in
front to inform your Majesty of the number and composition
of his household. After all I was mistaken.</p>

<p>In accordance with your Majesty’s instructions I
have written to Gienger,<a name="FNanchor_113_113" id="FNanchor_113_113"></a><a href="#Footnote_113_113" class="fnanchor">113</a> the Lord-Lieutenant, giving
him such information as I was able as to the dates of
the Queen’s route, the number of her attendants, &amp;c.,
&amp;c. I had had a letter from him, asking for this information.
So now, I think, everything has been
settled.</p>

<p class="noindent"><span class="smcap">I had</span> to undertake a second journey to Blois, on
behalf of your Imperial Majesty’s sister the Queen of
France (Elizabeth), and this has prevented my writing
again as soon as usual, for I was hoping from day to
day that my business would be settled one way or the
other, and I should be free to depart. In this I was
disappointed, and being unable to leave unfinished this
business, which is of material importance to the Queen,
I came at last to the conclusion that I must contrive
to despatch a letter from here; and this I am now
doing. When I was admitted to the King on the
business to which I alluded, I took the opportunity of
delivering to him your Imperial Majesty’s despatches;
the few words with which I introduced the subject
were to the effect, that your Imperial Majesty had
heard on good authority that he was a party to his
brother’s<a name="FNanchor_114_114" id="FNanchor_114_114"></a><a href="#Footnote_114_114" class="fnanchor">114</a> (Alençon’s) expedition into the Netherlands,
and that your Imperial Majesty did not believe the
statement; but that, if it was true, such interference
seriously affected the interests of your Majesty and the
Electors of the Empire and could not be tolerated, as
he would learn at greater length from your Imperial
Majesty’s own letter. To this the King answered
that he had no connection with his brother’s proceedings,
as might be shown from the fact that the mischief
done in the Netherlands was small in comparison to
what it would have been if his brother had had his
support in his late campaign. His brother, he added,
<span class="pagenum2"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">142</a></span>was not in the habit of asking or taking his advice;
besides, he was now causing more noise than harm;
nay, if there was any ground of complaint it affected
rather himself and his subjects, who had for months
been harassed and plundered by his brother’s soldiers,<a name="FNanchor_115_115" id="FNanchor_115_115"></a><a href="#Footnote_115_115" class="fnanchor">115</a>
while the farmers of the Netherlands were left unscathed;
he would see what your Majesty wrote, and
would send a reply.</p>

<p>I refrained from answering at greater length, and
in sharper language, out of regard to the Queen’s
interest, which does not allow of my lightly incurring
the displeasure of the French court. The King’s
reply will reach your Majesty at the same time as
this letter.</p>

<h3>LETTER II.</h3>

<p class="noindent"><span class="smcap">There</span> is now no doubt of the Prince of Orange being
alive and well; but his wife<a name="FNanchor_117_117" id="FNanchor_117_117"></a><a href="#Footnote_117_117" class="fnanchor">117</a> has died of an attack of
pleurisy. The Prince was at death’s door through the
bursting of the maxillary vein; the loss of blood was
very great, and there seemed no possibility of stopping
<span class="pagenum2"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">143</a></span>it, so that his life was despaired of. For thirty-six
hours he held the wound together, but fresh relays of
attendants were needed from time to time to prop up
his elbow with the hand, or otherwise he would have
been unequal to the exertion.</p>

<p>The Queen of England is said to have supplied
Alençon with a large sum of money, namely, 300,000
crowns. It is also said that a bill has been laid before
the States-General proposing, if they accept him as
their Sovereign, to grant him one-fifth of their property
towards the expenses of the war. If this be carried,
it will produce a very considerable sum, sufficient to
feed the war for a long time. The Prince of Parma
is besieging Oudenarde and battering its walls with
cannon; but the garrison are said to have sent word
to Alençon that he need fear nothing on their account
for the next two months. Meanwhile, by the capture
of Alost, which is now in Alençon’s hands, a serious
loss has been inflicted on the Prince of Parma, who
derived many great advantages from the possession of
the town. In it some gallant soldiers were slaughtered,
who preferred a glorious death to the dishonour of surrender.</p>

<p>Fifteen hundred German troopers, hired by Alençon,
are reported to be not far from Cambrai, with more to
follow. They are joined by many Frenchmen, apart
from those who are already in the Netherlands, and
they are numerous. Apparently it is Alençon’s purpose
to make the Prince of Parma abandon the siege of
Oudenarde by laying waste Hainault or Artois.</p>

<p>I hear Alençon has also sent emissaries into Italy
to hire horsemen as big as the Albanians.<a name="FNanchor_118_118" id="FNanchor_118_118"></a><a href="#Footnote_118_118" class="fnanchor">118</a></p>

<h3>LETTER III.</h3>

<p class="noindent"><span class="smcap">Sharp</span> fighting is going on. The Prince of Parma,
after an unsuccessful assault on Oudenarde, kept up a
roar of cannon throughout the following night, and battered
the walls without cessation, in order to prevent
the townsmen repairing the breaches. This is the
last news we have had, but people do not think the
town will be easy to storm, now that Alençon’s reinforcements
are coming up; they are scarcely two miles
from Arras, and if they do no more than burn the ripe
crops, it will be a crushing blow to that town, and also
to others whose harvests will be destroyed.</p>

hand, they say that Bouchain, a small but strongly fortified
town in Hainault, near Cambrai, has fallen into
Alençon’s hands through the treachery of the commandant
appointed by the Prince of Parma.</p>

<p>Alençon proclaims himself a great champion of
the Catholics, and in many places has restored their
churches to them. Hence some surmise that his reign
in those parts will not be a long one, as no dependence
can be placed in an alliance between parties of different
religious opinions; they think that the enemies of the
Catholics wink at these acts of his, on account of the
destruction which now threatens, but that, as soon as
the danger shall have passed by, changes will imme<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">145</a></span>diately

vows for the birth of a son. He will be absent on this

slightly in some particulars.</p>

<p>Among other details, we learn that Strozzi, and
the man they call Don Antonio’s Constable, were taken
prisoners, but were so severely wounded that they died
soon afterwards. The French declare that poison was
poured into their wounds to hasten their death. Forty
nobles were beheaded as pirates, because they were
unable to show any commission from the King authorising
the expedition; for the same reason three hundred
common soldiers were hanged. We hear also that the
victory was won by the Lisbon fleet alone, the co<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">147</a></span>operating
squadron<a name="FNanchor_120_120" id="FNanchor_120_120"></a><a href="#Footnote_120_120" class="fnanchor">120</a> not having come up in time to

are so exasperated that I think it will be a long time
before it will be safe for a Spaniard to show himself in
France; they will hurry with redoubled zeal into the
Netherlands—whether to avenge their countrymen’s
fall or share it, God only knows.</p>

<p>At any rate it is quite certain that large numbers of
soldiers are everywhere pouring into the Netherlands,
and that Alençon will shortly have a very large army.
The chiefs are the Prince Dauphin,<a name="FNanchor_122_122" id="FNanchor_122_122"></a><a href="#Footnote_122_122" class="fnanchor">122</a> Rochefoucauld,

an old and experienced leader, and people think that
this deficiency will be supplied at the right moment.
Biron is no doubt the man they mean. I mentioned in a
former letter that Alençon had asked for him, and been
refused by the King. People think, that when affairs
are ripe, he will avail himself of the King’s absence
to leave France secretly and join Alençon, by order of
the Queen Mother (Catherine de Medici), and moreover
that his example will be followed by several regiments
of royal cavalry which are quartered on the
Netherland frontier; just as lately happened when
Alençon was escorted to Cambrai.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">148</a></span></p>

<p>The Prince of Parma having drawn up his
whole army before the gates of Ghent, there was
some desultory fighting between light-armed troops on
either side, who skirmished in front of their respective
armies, while Alençon looked on from the walls. On
both sides men were slain, and the engagement ended
without advantage<a name="FNanchor_124_124" id="FNanchor_124_124"></a><a href="#Footnote_124_124" class="fnanchor">124</a> to either party. Alençon retired
with his people to Antwerp.</p>

<p>The garrison of Lier have commenced a kind of
fortification at the monastery of St. Bernard, which
will be a thorn in the side of the citizens of Antwerp
if they succeed in finishing it. Probably Alençon will
employ all his strength to prevent its completion.</p>

<p>From Scotland also we have news of disturbances,
that the Regent<a name="FNanchor_125_125" id="FNanchor_125_125"></a><a href="#Footnote_125_125" class="fnanchor">125</a> has been put to death, d’Aubigny is
besieged, and the young King himself deprived of his
liberty, and that all this has been done in the name of
the Estates. This news is accompanied by sundry
<em lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">canards</em>, viz. that the King of Spain has promised his
second daughter to the young King on condition of
his raising war against the Queen of England, and that
this has given such deep offence to the Duke of Savoy
that he is completely estranged from Philip, and altogether
in the French interest, intending to marry the
sister of Henry of Navarre.</p>

<p>Your Imperial Majesty will see in the document I
enclose evidence touching some plot against Alençon
and Orange. I can add nothing to the contents of
the document, except that the Salceda<a name="FNanchor_126_126" id="FNanchor_126_126"></a><a href="#Footnote_126_126" class="fnanchor">126</a> who is men<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">149</a></span>tioned

suspected that, when the time was ripe, Marshal Biron<span class="pagenum2"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">150</a></span>
would find his way to Alençon’s camp. The King
made him Governor of the French Netherlands, which
they call Picardy, to protect his interests in that
quarter, and take such precautions as occasion might
require. He also issued instructions to the authorities
on that part of the coast to place themselves under
Biron’s orders.</p>

<p>Great things were expected of him when he set
out, for he is considered the most experienced general
in France, having, during his long career, passed
through every grade and rank in the French army.</p>

<p>One of Alençon’s corps has joined him in Brabant,
the other and stronger corps is with Biron. To these
must be added the whole of the royal cavalry, which,
as I mentioned in a former letter, has been quartered
on the frontiers under pretence of guarding them. He
has, nevertheless, asked for more horse, for, while he
thinks himself quite a match for the Prince of Parma
in infantry, he considers himself very inferior in cavalry.
Accordingly, seven or eight squadrons of horse are
under orders to join him. Meanwhile, he has garrisoned
Peronne and St. Quentin so strongly as to
render them safe against any hostile attack. For the
Prince of Parma has been threatening in plain terms
that, if the French invade any part of his territories, he
will immediately march against St. Quentin. This
move of his, therefore, is now forestalled. Famine is
what the Prince of Parma has most to dread, especially
now that he has been cut off from the sea, and supplies
are not allowed to cross the French frontier.</p>

<p>There are many symptoms of the King’s becoming
more favourable to his brother’s enterprise. Without
any notice beforehand, certain commissioners were
lately appointed to inspect the ledgers of business men
generally, and specially those of the Italians, in order<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">151</a></span>
to see whether any moneys could be seized on their
way to the Prince of Parma. The investigation over,
two men were ordered to quit France, Capello of
Milan, and Calvi of Genoa, who were both suspected,
on very strong evidence, of having helped the King of
Spain by forwarding money to the Netherlands. At
one man’s house were seized 18,000 Italian gold pieces,
which had been deposited with him by a Spaniard.
These were confiscated to the crown, as there is an
Edict here forbidding people to have money of any
coinage save that of France; the only exception being
in favour of Spanish money. The coinage of every
other country must be brought to the royal Bank, and
changed at a heavy discount. The King melts down
the gold, and issues new coins bearing his own stamp.
Thus, not only have precautions been taken, by the
issue of a stringent proclamation, that Alençon’s opponents
should get no supplies from France to relieve
their famished troops, but it is evident that measures
are being set on foot to prevent their henceforth having
the means of purchasing provisions. The roads are
everywhere blocked to all who still acknowledge the
authority of the King of Spain, and so closely are they
watched that no one can pass through France without
being plundered or taken prisoner; nor can any remonstrance
be made on this score, since it is easy to
pretend that they are the acts of common highwaymen.</p>

<p>Up to the present date the posts have been permitted
to run openly and without interference into Spain; but
now a letter-carrier on his way to Spain has not been
allowed to have relays of horses, except on condition
of his giving security that he carries no despatches but
those of merchants. This order has prevented his
going forward, and so the man is detained in France.</p>

<p>The disaster which befell their countrymen in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">152</a></span>
Azores has had so little effect on the spirit of the
French, that it is intended to fit out a new fleet much
bigger than the last, and to place some Prince in command
of it. Ships accordingly have been selected,
which they are beginning to equip, so as to have them
ready against next spring. After all, the future is uncertain;
who can tell what may happen in the meantime?</p>

<p>Montpensier,<a name="FNanchor_127_127" id="FNanchor_127_127"></a><a href="#Footnote_127_127" class="fnanchor">127</a> father of the Prince Dauphin, has
departed this life, at a good old age. I shall, therefore,
for the future call his son Montpensier, when I have
occasion to mention him; for, in spite of his father’s
death, he is carrying out his intention of proceeding to
the Netherlands.</p>

<p>The man Salceda,<a name="FNanchor_128_128" id="FNanchor_128_128"></a><a href="#Footnote_128_128" class="fnanchor">128</a> whom I mentioned in former
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">153</a></span>despatches, has paid a heavy penalty for his crime;
what that crime was I do not know, but it must needs
have been monstrous to deserve so dreadful a doom.
Only one instance of such a punishment is found in
the whole history of Rome, viz. when Hostilius inflicted
it on Fuffetius. Whether he conspired against the life
of Alençon or the King, or both, I am not certain.
He was condemned to be torn asunder by four horses.
As soon as the horses began to pull, he said he had
something more to confess. When his confession had
been taken down by a notary, he asked to have his
right hand released,<a name="FNanchor_129_129" id="FNanchor_129_129"></a><a href="#Footnote_129_129" class="fnanchor">129</a> and when this was done, he wrote
something more, or at any rate signed his name.</p>

<p>When his hand had again been fastened to the
traces, and the horses, being started in different directions,
had made two distinct pulls, and yet failed to
pull him in two, he called out to the King, who with
his mother and wife was looking on from a window,
imploring mercy. Then his neck was broken, his
head severed from his shoulders, and his heart torn
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">154</a></span>out. The rest of his body was pulled asunder by the
horses. His head was sent to Antwerp, with orders
to have it stuck on the highest pinnacle in the city.
Such was the end of a wretch monstrous alike in his
wickedness, and in his audacity.</p>

<p>Here is a specimen. He purchased an estate, and
paid for it in bad money which he himself had coined.
The vendor discovered the fraud, brought an action
for treason against Salceda, and so recovered his house
and land. Salceda saved himself by flight from the
customary punishment, otherwise he would have been
put to death with boiling oil, but nevertheless he took
means to have fire set to the aforesaid house at night,
and the owner was within an ace of perishing with the
building. When the King, who sometimes visited his
place of confinement, upbraided him for his cruelty in
trying to destroy by such a fearful death the man
whom he had already cheated. ‘Well,’ quoth Salceda,
‘when he wanted to have me <em>boiled</em>, was it unreasonable
that I should try to have him <em>roasted</em>?’ What a
fund of wit the scoundrel must have had, when even at
such a time he must crack his jokes!</p>

<p>I am afraid that Count Egmont’s brother is
seriously compromised by Salceda’s evidence.<a name="FNanchor_130_130" id="FNanchor_130_130"></a><a href="#Footnote_130_130" class="fnanchor">130</a></p>

<p class="noindent"><span class="smcap">Biron</span> has halted on the banks of the Somme, and
intrenched himself. Some think that he will remain
there for a time to observe the development of the
Prince of Parma’s plans, and watch the result; for
<span class="pagenum2"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">155</a></span>they say that the daily losses of the Spanish army from
famine and pestilence are very heavy.</p>

<p>The Netherland letter carrier, who, as I mentioned,
was detained here, having given security through responsible
people, that he was conveying no letters
save those of merchants, was allowed to proceed on
his way to Spain.</p>

<p>The Spanish Ambassador was deeply annoyed at
Salceda’s head being sent to Antwerp with orders
from the King that it should be exposed to public
gaze on the highest pinnacle in the city, and reminded
the King in a solemn protest that he (the French
King) had no jurisdiction in Antwerp. The King was
taken aback, and had no answer to make except that
he had sent the head to his brother to do with it in
Antwerp as he would; or, to use the French phrase,
‘Qu’il en fist des petits pastez s’il vouloit.’</p>

<p>They say that Schomberg<a name="FNanchor_131_131" id="FNanchor_131_131"></a><a href="#Footnote_131_131" class="fnanchor">131</a> is going to Germany,
whether to hire soldiers I cannot say.</p>

<p>A messenger has just come from Languedoc with
the news that some Italian nobles, on their way back
from Spain, have been captured at sea by Huguenots,
and taken to the town of Aigues-Mortes. A brother
of the Marquis of Pescara is thought to be among
the captives, but nothing is known for certain, as
they refuse to give their names. Whoever they may
prove to be, if they are men of rank they are not
likely to get their liberty until La Noue<a name="FNanchor_132_132" id="FNanchor_132_132"></a><a href="#Footnote_132_132" class="fnanchor">132</a> is restored
to freedom.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">156</a></span></p>

<p>The King is again on a tour, having undertaken
a pilgrimage<a name="FNanchor_133_133" id="FNanchor_133_133"></a><a href="#Footnote_133_133" class="fnanchor">133</a> to the Blessed Virgin, Our Lady of Joy
(they call her Nostre Dame de Liesse), in the part
of Champagne adjoining Picardy, in the hope, we may
suppose, of gaining <em>joy</em> by the birth of a child.</p>

<p>They say the King has commissioned the Bretons
to build fifty galleys. There are also other signs of a
fleet being in prospect.</p>

<p class="noindent"><span class="smcap">They</span> say that the King has ordered 50,000 gold
pieces to be paid monthly towards Alençon’s expenses,
and that over and above this regular payment extra
money is to be sent from time to time.</p>

<p>No one now has the slightest doubt as to the fact
that Montpensier and Biron have joined Alençon,
making their way along the sea coast north of Bruges.
People think that Alençon will take them both into
his service, the former as chief Minister, and the latter
as Commander-in-chief, and that the Prince himself will
cross over into England, and, after having concerted
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">157</a></span>his plans with the Queen, will return to France for an
interview with his brother.</p>

<p>To the great content of his people the King is said
to be calling to account more vigorously than ever
those who are suspected of making away with Church
property.</p>

<p>The force Biron has taken with him is not numerous,
but it consists of picked troops, the royal
cavalry being left to guard the frontiers, and every one
having been sent back whose circumstances or disposition
appeared unsuited to the strain of a long campaign,
or whose licentious habits would render him intolerable
to the Netherlanders. He is supposed to have
taken with him 1,000 cavalry and 8,000 infantry.</p>

<p>Whatever others may think, I am confident that
this French invasion is a very serious matter; the
movement will grow and send forth roots which presently
it will be very difficult to get rid of. Whether
I look at its immediate results or more remote consequences,
the prospect is alarming.</p>

<p>Some assert that the troops of the Prince of Parma
are suffering from disease and famine, more especially
the new Italian levies, who are not yet hardened to the
cold of the Netherlands.</p>

<p>Before commencing his march towards Brabant,
the Prince of Parma retook Cateau Cambrésis; he is
said to be at present closely blockading Diest, which
belongs to the Prince of Orange, and unless it is
speedily relieved, its fall is certain. People think his
next enterprise will be an attack on Brussels.</p>

<p>There are crowds of Swiss ambassadors here, representing
nearly all the Cantons; they have come to
renew and ratify their treaty with the King of France;
there are great rejoicings at their arrival, and every
day they are magnificently entertained at State ban<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">158</a></span>quets,
given sometimes by the King, sometimes by the
city of Paris, or by the Guises and other Princes of the
Court. When these are terminated, and each of the
ambassadors has been presented with a weighty chain
of gold, they will be allowed to depart.</p>

<p>There is a report that the King and the Duke of
Lorraine will arrive here at the same time.</p>

<p>Some Frenchmen have lately returned from the
Azores, and report their position there to be perfectly
safe; they say there is no want of anything except
clothing, supplies of which are now being forwarded
as fast as possible. It appears, after Strozzi’s defeat,
a large proportion of the French ships and men retreated
to the islands. Meanwhile rumours as to the
new expedition are as rife as ever.</p>

<p>I must now say a word of what is going on in
France; the King has despatched distinguished men<a name="FNanchor_134_134" id="FNanchor_134_134"></a><a href="#Footnote_134_134" class="fnanchor">134</a>
of high position into all the provinces of the realm,
under pretence of correcting any errors and abuses in
the administration, and of hearing all complaints; but
the real object he has in view is to lay on the people a
new and heavy tax. The experiment does not appear
to be over successful; as to what will be the issue I
could not venture to speak positively, for what the
King has so often wished for he has not obtained!<a name="FNanchor_135_135" id="FNanchor_135_135"></a><a href="#Footnote_135_135" class="fnanchor">135</a></p>

<p class="noindent"><span class="smcap">It</span> is hardly worth telling, but still your Majesty may
like to hear of a scene which took place at Antwerp.
<span class="pagenum2"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">159</a></span>St. Luc was in Alençon’s chamber.<a name="FNanchor_136_136" id="FNanchor_136_136"></a><a href="#Footnote_136_136" class="fnanchor">136</a> (If I remember
rightly I told your Majesty in a previous letter that,
when he fell under the King’s displeasure, he joined
Alençon’s party.) Some noble or other said something
in his presence that annoyed him, and which he considered
to be a personal insult.</p>

<p>Thereon he gave him a blow in the face<a name="FNanchor_137_137" id="FNanchor_137_137"></a><a href="#Footnote_137_137" class="fnanchor">137</a> before
Alençon’s very eyes. The Prince of Orange, who was
present, was indignant at his behaviour, and, giving
vent to his wrath, plainly told Alençon that such outrageous
conduct ought not to go unpunished, and that
the Emperor, Charles the Fifth, had he been alive,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">160</a></span>would not have put up with it, but would have punished
the offender most severely, whatever his rank or position
might be. He told him that the chambers of
Princes ought to be inviolable and sacred ground, in
which brawling was not permissible.</p>

<p>On this St. Luc rejoined—I give you almost his
very words—‘Marry, is it Charles that you quote to
me? Why, if he were still alive, you would ere this
have lost your estates and your head.’ With these
words he flung out of the chamber, leaving all the
company dumbfounded at his outrageous conduct.</p>

<p class="noindent"><span class="smcap">The</span> Swiss Ambassadors have left Paris, after receiving
each a chain worth 500 gold pieces.<a name="FNanchor_138_138" id="FNanchor_138_138"></a><a href="#Footnote_138_138" class="fnanchor">138</a> There were
twenty-six to whom this honour was paid. Moreover,
the chiefs of the embassy were loaded with special
presents of plate, furniture, &amp;c. I append to my letter
a copy of the speech in which the King bade them farewell.
I was unable to learn the terms on which the
treaty was renewed, although I tried my best. It
would seem that our friends do not wish them to be
published. By these arrangements with the Swiss the
King has secured a supply of infantry. Of cavalry he
thinks he has abundance in his own realm. The
financial question has yet to be solved; his scheme for
coining<a name="FNanchor_139_139" id="FNanchor_139_139"></a><a href="#Footnote_139_139" class="fnanchor">139</a> money I described in one of my last letters;
and, though the plan has not hitherto met with much
<span class="pagenum2"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">161</a></span>success, the provinces turning a deaf ear to requests of
this kind, nevertheless, such efforts are still being
made, that I should not like to pledge myself positively
as to what will be the result.</p>

<p>Don Antonio has come back to France with a few
ships; the reason of his return I have not discovered;
possibly he did not think himself safe in the Azores;
or it may have been that he considered his presence and
influence would be of service in promoting the new
expedition. At any rate, he is here, and has been
already on several occasions admitted to a private interview
with the Queen Mother (Catherine de Medici).
A lodging has been given him close to the palace, built
by the young Queen, whither she is often wont to
retire.</p>

<p>A few days ago this same Don Antonio set out for
Dieppe, in order personally to hasten the equipment of
the fleet, which in his absence was going on more slackly
than he liked. I cannot describe how exasperated all
our friends are against the Spaniards, and how eagerly
they desire war. A book is said to be in the press, in
which the claims of the elder Queen<a name="FNanchor_140_140" id="FNanchor_140_140"></a><a href="#Footnote_140_140" class="fnanchor">140</a> (Catherine de
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">162</a></span>Medici) to the kingdom of Portugal are set forth at
great length.</p>

<p>When the Prince of Orange was dangerously ill of the
fever, from which, by the way, he is now reported to be
convalescent, prayers for his recovery were offered
up, not only throughout the Netherlands, but also in
France, by the churches of the Reformed religion, as
they call themselves. The Prince of Parma has received
the surrender of Diest and several other obscure
places. These successes will seriously endanger Brussels,
unless the state of affairs should be changed by
the arrival of the troops under Biron, who is a redoubtable
antagonist; it is said that he is going into the
Campine<a name="FNanchor_141_141" id="FNanchor_141_141"></a><a href="#Footnote_141_141" class="fnanchor">141</a> to attack certain places, the loss of which
will derange Parma’s plans. Alençon has prevailed
upon the citizens of Antwerp<a name="FNanchor_142_142" id="FNanchor_142_142"></a><a href="#Footnote_142_142" class="fnanchor">142</a> to have lodgings in the
city assigned to three hundred French noblemen.</p>

<p>They say that news has come of the death of the
Duke of Alva in Spain. The garrison at Cateau
Cambrésis, being strong in cavalry, causes great annoyance
to the French at Cambrai, and is for ever
scouring the surrounding district. The insolence of
the French soldiers at Dunkirk provoked the citizens
to rise against the garrison; the attempt was put down
with great slaughter. Everyone here is talking of the
troubles at Cologne;<a name="FNanchor_143_143" id="FNanchor_143_143"></a><a href="#Footnote_143_143" class="fnanchor">143</a> after all this smoke, as I may
call it, we must expect a fire.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">163</a></span></p>

<p>The Duke of Lorraine has arrived here with his
two sons; why he came I cannot tell, but it is commonly
supposed that his object is to betroth his daughter
to the Duke of Savoy, and to demand the hand of
the King of Navarre’s sister for his eldest son.</p>

<p>May God Almighty bless and keep your Majesty
through the year we have now begun, and for many
more. At the same time I venture most humbly
to ask for a settlement of the purchase of the Greek
books, which has been standing over for so many
years.</p>

<h3>LETTER XIV.</h3>

<p class="noindent"><span class="smcap">News</span> has arrived from Brabant by way of England,
which has thrown the Queen (Catherine de Medici)
and the whole nation into the greatest alarm. The
account is vague, but the purport of the tidings is to
the effect that a quarrel arose at Antwerp,<a name="FNanchor_144_144" id="FNanchor_144_144"></a><a href="#Footnote_144_144" class="fnanchor">144</a> between
the French and the citizens, and that the French force
was annihilated.</p>

<p>The anxiety was greatly increased by the silence
of Alençon; and, when no despatches arrived from
him, serious doubts were entertained as to his safety.
In this uncertainty several days passed by; at length
messengers came pouring in, who told us the particulars
of the affair, but still their accounts were defective
in several important points, and differed in details.</p>

<p>I will relate what I made out as the nearest
approximation to the truth: the points which I do not
yet know about, I will fill in afterwards, and also
correct any mistakes I may have made. I think I
wrote to your Imperial Majesty that Alençon intended
to travel to France, by way of England, for the
purpose of visiting the King, and, as we may well
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">165</a></span>suppose, of discussing with him the affairs and general
condition of the Netherlands, and that his intention
was to leave Montpensier and Biron as his lieutenants
during his absence. But when Alençon applied to
Biron to undertake this duty, the marshal was unwilling
to accept the command, on the ground that he
would have a restless and turbulent race to deal with,
and no place to retreat to in case of misfortune. He
reminded the Prince that such a large assemblage of
French noblemen could not be withheld from committing
occasional excesses and provoking the citizens,
who would then immediately rise and threaten death
to every Frenchman; and he thought the best means
of meeting this danger would be for the French to
hold some place to which they could retreat for refuge
against the violence of the mob. For this purpose the
citadel (of Antwerp) was admirably adapted; it needed
but a few repairs and a strong garrison; there were
now in the city a great many Frenchmen, both gentle
and simple, who could easily seize the citadel, nor
again would it be difficult to gain possession of one of
the city gates, and, his army being so near, to throw
into the town as many men as he chose. Further, the
inspection of the forces which he (Biron) had brought
with him, furnished Alençon with an excellent pretext
for going out of the city and not mixing himself up
with these irregular proceedings; all that was needed
was the approval of Alençon and the nobles of his
court.</p>

<p>On hearing Biron’s views, which were so well calculated
to please Alençon’s licentious and lawless nobles,
the greater part gave their adherence to his plan,
whilst a sense of shame induced the more honourable
men to agree to it, lest they should be thought cowards
for shrinking from so important an enterprise. Alen<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">166</a></span>çon
was the last to yield to the united wishes of his
followers.</p>

<p>On the next day he went out to the camp, but
as he passed the gate several of his body-guard,
desperate fellows who had been selected for this
service, halted on the bridge leading across the
moat into the open country, instead of following the
Prince. The citizens, who were guarding the bridge
and the gate, warned the Frenchmen to clear the
bridge, either by following their lord, or by returning
into the city. The men listened with apparent deference
to what was said, but none the less remained on
the bridge; then the language of the men of Antwerp
grew rougher, and the French retorted in words every
whit as bold; so from words they came to blows; the
French, who were all musketeers and came prepared
for action, easily wounded, killed, or drove away the
townsmen, and so took possession of the bridge and
gate. They were joined by others, both horse and foot,
who had left Alençon’s escort and had halted in the
neighbourhood for that purpose; they formed a column,
and in one compact mass burst into the town. The
uproar alarmed the citizens stationed on the walls;
from both sides of the gate they hurried to the fray,
and climbing down into the road began to fight with
the party who had been left to guard the entrance; the
contest ended in the victory of the townsmen, who
succeeded in beating their opponents and shutting the
gate. They say that presently Alençon rode back and
demanded admission, but the cannon’s mouth was the
only mouth that answered!</p>

<p>Meantime, the French spread themselves through
the city; on every side they could see the townsmen
flocking to the fray, but there was no quailing or fear,
for they felt certain that their superior skill would<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">167</a></span>
ensure their victory over a set of untrained civilians.
Some made for the citadel, others, without any thought
for that which was the real object of the enterprise,
began plundering private houses; but it was not long
before their ranks were broken by the charge of the
men of Antwerp, and, with a few exceptions, they
paid with their lives the penalty of their rash attempt.</p>

<p>They say that the Queen Mother, on hearing the
news, burst into tears, and cried ‘Alençon, Alençon,
would you had died long years ago, rather than so
many of our nobles should have perished through you,
and such great trouble and distress have been brought
upon France! Moreover, you are also endangering the
safety of the realm, for you have brought yourself, the
heir of the throne, into the most imminent peril, and
every effort will be needed if you are to be extricated
from your unfortunate position.’</p>

<p>They say that the Duke of Guise has tendered his
services to the Queen, promising, if 3,000 French
horse are given him, to find Alençon, wherever he may
be, and bring him home. Round him accordingly the
nobles are gathering, and the clatter of the armourer’s
hammer is to be heard in every street. But I do not
myself believe that anything will come of it.</p>

<p>This scheme of Biron<a name="FNanchor_145_145" id="FNanchor_145_145"></a><a href="#Footnote_145_145" class="fnanchor">145</a> (assuming that it is his
scheme) will go far to confirm the judgment of those
who maintain that, though an active and experienced
commander, he is in all other respects a person of little
discernment. Alençon, being shut out of Antwerp,
spent the night with his army at the monastery of St.
Bernard. There he was joined by the officers of his
household. They had remained in their quarters
during the disturbance, and, being held guiltless of any
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">168</a></span>part in the conspiracy, were sent back to their master
by the men of Antwerp. However, Alençon’s first
object was to cross the Scheldt before any attempt
should be made to obstruct the passage; so all night
the Swiss were hard at work building a bridge. As
soon as it was finished, he crossed from Brabant into
Flanders, and came to Dendermonde, where he is
supposed to be still lying. The question now is, what
is he to do? Ought he to lead his forces back to
France, and abandon all interest in the Netherlands?
Or again, ought he to make up his quarrel with the
people of Antwerp? Now that there is an end of all
confidence between them, I fail to see how this latter
alternative is possible; but the French are wonderful
fellows when they set their minds on a thing!</p>

<p>These details, which I have picked out of several
different versions, I have thought it my duty to place
before your Majesty. Time will give us further particulars,
and accounts on which we can better rely.</p>

<p>Your Majesty and the Archduke<a name="FNanchor_146_146" id="FNanchor_146_146"></a><a href="#Footnote_146_146" class="fnanchor">146</a> Ernest are supposed
to have played a part in this drama. This
notion was very rife when the news first came, and no
particulars had as yet transpired. Some people about
the Court, who fancied themselves to be wondrous
wise, would have it that the eldest daughter of the
King of Spain was betrothed to your Majesty, and
the younger to the Archduke Ernest, with all the
provinces of the Netherlands as her dowry, and that it
was, therefore, of prime importance to your Majesty
and the Archduke that the French in Antwerp should
be cut to pieces, and Alençon driven from the city;
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">169</a></span>that on this account there had been secret negotiations
with the townsmen, who had been promised an amnesty
for all past offences, on condition of their
exterminating the French; and further, that your
Majesty and the Archduke had secured the concurrence
and assistance of the Prince of Orange; for they
argue, the townsmen of Antwerp would never have
ventured to go so far had they not been thus aided
and abetted.</p>

<p>The Prince of Orange, it appears, had a presentiment
of what was coming, and when Alençon desired
to have his company to the camp, he steadily refused
to go, giving as an excuse the state of his health and
the badness of the weather. His presence saved the
lives of several Frenchmen, among whom was Fervaques,
one of Alençon’s favourite officers. But here
in France this gentleman’s life is in danger in quite
another way. They declare that the scheme of seizing
the citadel was his suggestion, and wish him to be
tried and executed. It is thought that a reconciliation
between Alençon and the citizens of Antwerp will be
brought about by the intervention of the King, who
will send men of note to conduct the negotiations; the
names of Bellièvre and Pibrac are mentioned as members
of the commission. The latter is also marked
out as Alençon’s chancellor.</p>

<p>So far from blaming the men of Antwerp, the
French are actually beginning to praise them for their
kind feeling and politic behaviour, for it appears that,
after the excitement had abated, they showed every
possible attention to their prisoners, and to those of the
Frenchmen who had remained in their quarters.</p>

<h3>LETTER XV.</h3>

<p class="noindent"><span class="smcap">I felt</span> confident, when I despatched my last letter
to your Majesty, that it would not be long before I
should have further news of a more trustworthy description
from Antwerp. After all, I am disappointed;
though several days have elapsed, there has been no
fresh arrival from the Netherlands of anyone able, or at
any rate willing, to tell us the truth of what happened.
The few who have come were all sent by Alençon
to the King, to repeat a set story which was put into
their mouths, and hide the blackness of Alençon’s case
under a cloud of specious words. There is no letter-carrier
or merchant from Antwerp; indeed, the wardens
of the marches put a complete stop to the travelling of
Frenchmen to Antwerp, and of Antwerp people to
France. Of late, however, the restrictions have been
removed, and the merchandise, on which an embargo
had been laid, having been released by both sides, the
old rules, regulating the commercial intercourse between
the two countries, are once more in force. But,
in spite of this change, scarce anyone will run the risk
of so hazardous a journey. One letter-carrier, it is
true, has come by way of England, but he has brought
no fresh tidings, except that the number of slain and
captured is greater than was at first reported; in other
respects his news differs little from the account given
in my last letter.</p>

<p>Alençon’s friends, and those who are anxious to
save his reputation, say that, though he is a mild and
gracious Prince, yet, being no longer able to stomach
the pretensions of the Prince of Orange and the independent
ways of the men of Antwerp, so distasteful to
a Frenchman, he endeavoured to take possession of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">171</a></span>
the city, as the best means of freeing himself from his
intolerable position, not having any idea that the enterprise
would be either difficult or attended with much
loss of life; but expecting that, after a few citizens had
been killed at the first entry of the troops, the remainder
would be so terrified as to abandon all thought
of defence, and, laying down their arms, would submit
to any conditions he might think fit to impose, provided
that their lives were spared, so that he would have
an excellent opportunity of binding down the city of
Antwerp to his own terms. But he was utterly mistaken
in his calculations, for he did not find the hearts
of the citizens so tame, or their arms so weak, as
Frenchmen would have them to be.</p>

<p>Some people put a totally different construction on
the whole affair; but this is Alençon’s explanation.
As to what really took place, it seems needless to write
more, for your Majesty is no doubt in possession of all
the facts, since there has been far freer communication
with Germany than with France. In case, however,
anything should be lacking, I enclose three documents.
(1) The statement of the citizens of Antwerp, published
in their own language. (2) A paper which is
attributed to Bodin,<a name="FNanchor_147_147" id="FNanchor_147_147"></a><a href="#Footnote_147_147" class="fnanchor">147</a> author of the treatise <cite lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">De la République</cite>,
published a few years ago. The letter is
written in French. (3) A paper which is the production
of some unknown person, but it is plain that he is
a Frenchman, and his account is evidently untrustworthy.</p>

<p>Mirambeau, the brother of Lausac, was first de<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">172</a></span>spatched
to Alençon by the King, and later on Bellièvre.
The issue is still uncertain. Some think Alençon and
the States will come to terms, while others are positive
they will not. As to my own opinion, I have determined
to reserve my judgment till time shall bring
more certain news.</p>

<p>In the meanwhile several of the King’s commissioners,
who were sent round to collect money, have
returned. They report that nothing is to be obtained
without the risk of an insurrection, and that all reply
that if the King is straitened in any way, they know
their duty: but in their opinion, his only object in asking
for money is to lavish it on his young favourites;
they consider such grants unreasonable, and will have
nothing to say to them.</p>

<p>I am not surprised, for a gentleman in the royal
treasury, on whose word I can rely, told me that since
his return from Poland the King has squandered six
million crowns in presents and other useless expenses.
The King having been disappointed of these supplies,
people think he will deprive the Queens Dowager of a
large part of their property, to satisfy the claims of his
young favourites. Your Imperial Majesty’s sister will
be one of the sufferers, as, in violation of the marriage
treaty, she has long ago been placed on the same footing
as the other Queens Dowager.<a name="FNanchor_148_148" id="FNanchor_148_148"></a><a href="#Footnote_148_148" class="fnanchor">148</a></p>

<p>We have in France, as Governor of Brittany, a
brother of the Queen Consort, son of Vaudemont; his
title is the Duke of Mercœur.<a name="FNanchor_149_149" id="FNanchor_149_149"></a><a href="#Footnote_149_149" class="fnanchor">149</a> News was brought
during his absence from home that he had died of the
plague. Two men immediately asked for his post,
Nevers<a name="FNanchor_150_150" id="FNanchor_150_150"></a><a href="#Footnote_150_150" class="fnanchor">150</a> and the Duke of Epernon, who stands well
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">173</a></span>nigh first among the King’s favourites. Nevers’ application
was refused, and the other appointed Governor
of Brittany, conditionally on the office being vacant.</p>

<p>Though the appointment came to nothing, since
news shortly arrived of the Duke of Mercœur’s recovery,
yet Nevers was so indignant that he then and
there gave orders to his retainers to prepare to leave
the Court, and two days later retired home, after first
upbraiding the King for his ingratitude.</p>

<p>The King’s conduct in this matter is being unfavourably
criticised by many, and especially by the
aristocracy.</p>

<p>March 20, 1583.</p></blockquote>

<hr />
<h3>LETTER XVI.</h3>

<p class="noindent"><span class="smcap">We</span> have still no news from Antwerp of Alençon.
Most people agree with Mirambeau in thinking that
there is little hope of a friendly arrangement, the demands
of the States being exorbitant; they ask for the
restoration of Dunkirk and Cambrai, and henceforth
refuse to permit any one, who is not a Netherlander
born, to hold place in the suite or service of Alençon.</p>

<p>The King is moving infantry and cavalry to the
frontier, so as to have them ready should need arise. I
doubt whether even with this help Alençon’s journey
is likely to be very rapid, as the district through which
his road lies is deep in mud at this season.</p>

<p>Meantime the men of Antwerp are said to be exacting
money from their prisoners, and demanding
ransom for having spared their lives. Whether it be
so or not, the breach between them and Alençon seems
to be complete, so that they will hardly readmit him
into the town.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">174</a></span></p>

<p>Bellièvre stops behind with the hopeless task of
trying to arrange matters; there is an idea that, by his
oratorical powers and diplomatic skill, the wrath of the
Netherlanders may be appeased, and the way paved
to an agreement. But it is with the men of Antwerp
as it was with Alençon; success was too much for
his ill-regulated mind, and has proved his ruin; even
so some great disaster will overtake the citizens, if
they wax thus presumptuous on the strength of this
unexpected victory.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>April 12, 1583.</p></blockquote>

<hr />
<h3>LETTER XVII.</h3>

<p class="noindent"><span class="smcap">This</span> very day it is still uncertain as to what will be
the issue of the affair at Antwerp. Though there
are the plainest signs of the deepest exasperation
on both sides, there are some who think an arrangement
possible; they admit that no real peace or friendship
can hereafter exist, now that confidence has
received so rude a shock, with the Netherlanders estranged
from Alençon by the recollection of his dishonourable
conduct, and Alençon burning to avenge the
heavy punishment he has received; but still hold that
it is to the interest of both parties that some sort of
reconciliation should be patched up, and the former
alliance be preserved, or at least the appearance of it.
To what other quarter, they ask, can the Netherlanders
look for assistance against the powerful foes who surround
them, or what other help have they than their
French allies? Or again, what could be more disastrous
to Alençon’s reputation, than thus to withdraw from
Brabant with the disgrace of having lost by his folly
the provinces which had so unexpectedly fallen into his<span class="pagenum2"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">175</a></span>
hands, and to have his shame blazed abroad throughout
the world, which is watching the result of his
enterprise? When a man has damaged his reputation,
oftentimes, if he is only patient, an opportunity will
come, which will enable him to restore it. But if, in
spite of these considerations, Alençon must leave the
Netherlands at an early date, still, if an interval is
allowed to elapse, he will be able to avail himself of
those numerous excuses for departure which may
arise,—or, at the worst, can be invented,—and thus
diminish materially the disgrace of his failure. Accordingly
they hold an arrangement to be possible on
the basis of a general amnesty. But this appears to
me to be easier said than done! Brussels, according
to their programme, is to be assigned to Alençon as a
residence, and there also the Estates of the Netherlands
are to meet; a few towns in the neighbourhood are
likewise to be given him, that he may feel more secure.
Brussels to be guarded by 1,500 Swiss and 500 French
troops. Orange to be appointed Alençon’s Lieutenant,
or Imperial Vicar. The prisoners at Antwerp to be
discharged conditionally on remuneration being given
to their hosts who rescued them from the violence of
the people. In all other matters the late treaty to
stand good.</p>

<p>In this arrangement the case of Fervaques is the
chief difficulty. The citizens of Antwerp hold him to
be the instigator and ringleader of this atrocious plot,
and demand his execution.</p>

<p>Biron, by the way, has written a letter to the Queen
Mother, in which he completely clears himself of all
blame. He says he came too late to take any part in
the discussion, the matter was already decided, and
his share in the business consisted simply in yielding
to Alençon’s wishes and executing his pleasure.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">176</a></span></p>

<p>Some talk of a reconciliation on the terms which I
have given; but what will happen it is impossible to
say. It is well known that the other day, when Orange
went into the town hall of Antwerp to make a speech
in favour of reconciliation, a mob assembled in the
market place, shouting and threatening to throw anyone
out of the window who ventured to propose the
readmission of the French. Orange, they say, was
so alarmed by this demonstration that he spent the
night in the town hall. Though a considerable space
of time has elapsed, scarce a single Antwerp man has
crossed the French frontier, although the road is open,
and this, to my mind, is the surest proof that the prospects
of a reconciliation are dubious; so long as there
is a doubt as to the renewal of the alliance and arrangement
of terms, none of them care to risk their lives by
entering France.</p>

<p>So much for this subject.</p>

<p>Men, on whose authority I can rely, tell me that
the King is pressing the Duke of Lorraine to betroth
his daughter, who is now grown up and a great heiress,
to the Duke of Epernon, but that Lorraine, who loathes
the idea of such a <em lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">mésalliance</em>, is doing his utmost to
avoid giving his consent to so unsuitable a match,
taking refuge in a proposition that, if the King will
bring about a marriage between his son, the Prince of
Lorraine, and the sister of the King of Navarre, he in
return will gladly comply with his request. This last
is a young lady who, if her brother, as is not unlikely,
should die childless, has very great prospects indeed.
For the King of Navarre’s wife has not yet presented
him with a child, and she is young enough to make it
probable that she will be the survivor. The family
feuds, however, which have been handed down from
father to son, between the Bourbons and the Guises<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">177</a></span>
and House of Lorraine, render Navarre’s consent to
the match highly improbable. The Duke of Lorraine
sees clearly that Navarre inherited these feuds when
he inherited the Crown, so he protects himself behind
this entrenchment; whether it will be strong enough
for his purposes time will show.</p>

<p>I must now give a description of Epernon. By the
King’s favour he has been created duke; five years
ago, before he became intimate with the King, he was
a poor unknown man, who passed by the name of
La Valette; at the outside his income did not exceed
400 crowns; his father was a gallant soldier, but his
grandfather was a scrivener or notary. Now this
upstart is a duke, and, what is more, a wealthy duke,
for he can always dip his fingers into the royal treasury.
But his present position is nothing to what he
has in prospect; he aspires to one of the great dignities
of the realm, and a governorship of the first rank,
such as that of Brittany, touching which I wrote the
other day. If, in addition to this promotion, he should
obtain a wife so nearly connected with the King that no
other Frenchman, however high his rank, would venture
to aspire to her hand, he will be one of the most
marvellously successful men that ever lived; and yet
neither in birth nor deserts has he aught to boast of;
in the King’s opinion no doubt he is a man of great
promise, but no one else thinks so; whether it be envy,
or his own fault, that causes him to be thus esteemed,
I cannot say, but almost every one detests him on
account of his exclusive and supercilious manners, and
there is no one so hated by the Princes of France.</p>

<p>His colleague, if I may so term him, who, however,
takes precedence of him, is the Duke (formerly
Count) of Joyeuse, husband of the Queen’s<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">178</a></span>
sister; this last, however, has the advantages given by
ancient and illustrious descent, amiable disposition,
and natural talent; the other day he was made Admiral
of France, now he has been appointed Governor
of the whole of Normandy; in order to give him this
command, three noblemen of the highest rank, who
shared the province amongst them, had to be turned
out. These two young fellows are the men in whose
friendship the King considers himself blessed, and
envies not the success of Alexander the Great! This
infatuation of the King’s awakes the indignation and
despair of France. The men who formerly held the
highest positions next to the throne fly from the
Court to avoid the painful sight; the rest are dumbfoundered
at the King’s caprices.</p>

<p>This is the reason the King is always in difficulties,
always poor, never able to reward or honour a good
servant; his wealth is being piled on these young
fellows, and they are being fashioned out of nothing
into pillars of the State, so that they may occupy the
greatest places in France. Amongst those who are
greatly offended is Alençon; he is intensely indignant
at being assisted with so niggardly a hand in an enterprise
which he considers of the first importance, and
complains that the King thinks more of his favourites
than of his brother.<a name="FNanchor_151_151" id="FNanchor_151_151"></a><a href="#Footnote_151_151" class="fnanchor">151</a></p>

<p>As I shall often have occasion to allude to these
gentlemen, I have described them at some length, so
that, when they are referred to, your Majesty may have
some idea of them.</p>

<p>Don Antonio is still at Rouen and Dieppe, busily
engaged in the equipment of his fleet, or fleetlet, if I
may so term it, for it falls far short of what was talked
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">179</a></span>of, and will carry scarce 500 soldiers to reinforce his
troops in the Azores.</p>

<p>Great supplies will be collected of such things as
are needed in those localities.</p>

residence. When he gets there, people think
he will cross over to France, press his grievances upon
the King, and ask him why he is more anxious for
the aggrandisement of certain young fellows than for
the prosecution of a most important enterprise.</p>

<p>Orange has invited from France Teligny’s widow,
daughter of Coligny, some time Admiral of France,

the King ordered him to leave the city.</p>

<p>Touching the Flagellants there is a merry story to

mimicking in the palace itself certain rites of the
brotherhood;<a name="FNanchor_156_156" id="FNanchor_156_156"></a><a href="#Footnote_156_156" class="fnanchor">156</a> the King ordered some eighty of them

<p class="noindent"><span class="smcap">The</span> reports of fresh disturbances, which I mentioned
lately, are gaining ground, and worst of all, there is
no certainty as to whether Alençon is concerned in
them or not.</p>

<p>In consequence of these rumours his mother
(Catherine de Medici) has been for some time intend<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">181</a></span>ing
to visit him at Calais, but he has been detained at
Dunkirk by sickness; he is supposed to be suffering
from the French disease, and has placed himself in
the hands of his physicians and surgeons. As soon
as he recovers, people think he will cross over to
Calais; but there is no telling, for some maintain that
he will go to Normandy, and others that he will take
ship for Brittany. If war ensues the King will be in
great straits, since neither financially, nor in any other
way, is he prepared to meet it.</p>

<p>Bellièvre has returned from Antwerp; he tells us
that concessions have been made on both sides, and
all obstacles to a satisfactory understanding removed.</p>

<p>One of the points arranged was the release of the
prisoners, amongst whom was Fervaques; on this
gentleman’s rejoining Alençon the latter presented
him with an abbacy<a name="FNanchor_157_157" id="FNanchor_157_157"></a><a href="#Footnote_157_157" class="fnanchor">157</a> worth 6,000 crowns per annum,
in acknowledgment no doubt of his brilliant conception
and its admirable execution! When this was
told to the Queen Mother (Catherine de Medici) she
lost all patience, and called Alençon a fool and madman,
repeating her words again and again.</p>

<p>A letter of Biron’s has been discovered in Alençon’s
cabinet at Antwerp, written the day before the
disastrous attempt of the French, in which he does
his utmost to induce Alençon to abandon his foolish
scheme. This discovery has made Biron extremely
popular at Antwerp; in fact he stands first in favour of
the citizens, and this is the man on whose head not
long ago rested most of the odium!</p>

<p>Pibrac, who lately joined Alençon, has been
despatched by him to Antwerp as his representative
with the States; he is an ambassador who will, I
fancy, cause more mischief than several thousand
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">182</a></span>soldiers. Endhoven, a little town of Brabant, has
capitulated to the King (of Spain) in spite of de Bonnivet’s
defence. On the other hand, Biron has retaken
some small forts. They say that the Prince of Parma
is making preparations for the siege of Alost, thus
threatening Brussels.</p>

<p class="noindent"><span class="smcap">The</span> King’s inordinate devotion to religious observances
is the subject of general remark; some
declare that he will end by changing his crown for a
cowl. The Queen Mother, they say, disgusted with
the way he neglects his duties as Sovereign, roundly
rebuked one Edmund,<a name="FNanchor_158_158" id="FNanchor_158_158"></a><a href="#Footnote_158_158" class="fnanchor">158</a> a Jesuit, who is the King’s
chief adviser, for having well nigh turned her son from
a king into a monk, to the great detriment of the realm.</p>

<p>Meanwhile serious disturbances are taking place in
Aquitaine and Languedoc. In consequence of these
movements the King has despatched Monsieur du
Ferrier, whom he employed for a long time as his ambassador
at Venice, to the King of Navarre. He is
an old man and reputed wise.</p>

<p>The Queen Mother would have rushed to meet
Alençon at Calais, if he had not written to stop her,
warning her that a visit from her would wake the suspicions
of the States of the Netherlands, and so
damage his prospects. This is the excuse he gives,
but most people think his letter was written to suit the
views of the gentlemen responsible for the catastrophe
at Antwerp, who are afraid of meeting with hard
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">183</a></span>language and reproaches from the Queen, and haply
also of being dismissed from their places.</p>

<p>Don Antonio was here the other day with the
Queen, having run away from Dieppe and Rouen on
account of the plague. He has now left for a village
in the neighbourhood called Ruel, where he is living in
a pleasant house lent him by Alençon. His household
consists of some sixty people, who consume daily a
quarter of an ox, two sheep, one calf, and 150 loaves.</p>

<p>It is now quite certain that Orange openly assumes
the position of Count of Holland. Flushing,<a name="FNanchor_159_159" id="FNanchor_159_159"></a><a href="#Footnote_159_159" class="fnanchor">159</a> a city of
Zealand, he bought with his own money; so that he
commands the communications of those provinces with
the sea. Thus amid the downfall and ruin of others
Orange has secured a success.</p>

<p>The King is preparing for a journey to Mézières,
with the intention of going on to a château called
Foullenbraye, where he will stay to drink the Spa waters
for the benefit of his health. During his absence the
government is placed in the hands of the Queen Mother
and the Privy Council. It is thought he will be away
the whole summer. His days, I fear, are numbered.</p>

<p>After several feints, by which he kept every one
in suspense as to where he would next strike, Parma
has settled down to the siege of Cambrai. It will be a
tedious affair, and success is by no means certain, still
the capture of the town would go far towards deciding
the struggle. He is said, moreover, to have recovered
the town of Diest. Brussels, too, seems inclined to
go over.</p>

<p>People are again beginning to be afraid of the
plague. There are serious signs of its presence in
Paris, and also in several other French towns.</p>

<h3><a name="xxi" id="xxi">LETTER XXI.</a></h3>

<p class="noindent"><span class="smcap">The</span> Queen Mother has been with the King. After
her interview she flew off to Boulogne-sur-Mer to meet
Alençon, with Marshal de Retz in attendance on her.
Alençon himself is levying fresh soldiers with the purpose,
I suppose, of sending them to the relief of
Cambrai.</p>

<p>The States and Biron have received a severe
check at Steenbergen,<a name="FNanchor_160_160" id="FNanchor_160_160"></a><a href="#Footnote_160_160" class="fnanchor">160</a> losing a great many men.
Biron was wounded, and had difficulty in protecting
himself behind the walls of Steenbergen.</p>

<p>The Governor of Namur has been sent by Parma
to the King. A messenger also came from Casimir to
ask a free passage through France; he is sending
him to the Queen of England about the Cologne
business. The Pope, through his nuncio, is urging
the King to accept the decrees of the Council of Trent,
and to publish them throughout the kingdom. I do
not think his representations will have much effect,
not because the King is a supporter of the privileges
of the Gallican Church, but because there is a suspicion
that the real object is the introduction of the Inquisition
into France. Fresh disturbances would be the
certain consequence of so unpopular a measure.</p>

<p>For these reasons people say the King, though
personally disposed to accede to the demands of the
Pope, will not grant them, being determined, as far as
in him lies, to avoid all risk of rebellion and civil war.</p>

<p>The King was desirous of placing the Duke of
Epernon in command of Metz, but the present governor
is an obstacle. He refuses to transfer his command to
any one until he shall have received the reward due
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">185</a></span>
to him for long service in the army and years of honest
work. In my opinion the King has another reason
for prolonging his stay in those parts. Cologne is not
far distant, and he may be thinking of making his own
advantage out of the disturbances.</p>

<p>Then, after conducting his wife to Bourbon-les-Bains,
he will make a <em lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">détour</em> to Lyons, not returning
to Paris till the end of the summer.</p>

<p>The Duke of Joyeuse is expected back. He crossed
the mountains into Italy with a brilliant train on a pilgrimage
to the shrine of the Holy Virgin of Loreto,
in fulfilment of a vow he had undertaken when his
wife was ill.</p>

<p>On his way he visited Rome to do reverence to
the Pope, and possibly also to give him a private message<a name="FNanchor_161_161" id="FNanchor_161_161"></a><a href="#Footnote_161_161" class="fnanchor">161</a>
from the King.</p>

<p>The men of Antwerp have lost a great deal of
their old confidence and love for Orange, who seems
only to care for making his kingdom of Holland secure,
and does not pay sufficient attention to the safety of
the other provinces. From Brussels also there is news
of some disturbance, touching which I am expecting a
report from a trusty correspondent.</p>

<p>Meanwhile I pray God to grant good health to
your Imperial Majesty, whose most humble servant I
remain.</p>

<p class="noindent"><span class="smcap">As</span> the Queen Mother was hastening through Picardy
to Boulogne, Alençon met her at La Fère. He did
<span class="pagenum2"><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">186</a></span>not leave Dunkirk an hour too soon. No sooner
had he gone than Parma’s army sat down before
it, and the siege was so skilfully conducted that the
garrison were compelled to surrender;<a name="FNanchor_162_162" id="FNanchor_162_162"></a><a href="#Footnote_162_162" class="fnanchor">162</a> they were, however,
able to obtain honourable terms. With Dunkirk
Alençon has lost all footing in the Netherlands
except Cambrai, and even that is hard pressed and in
great want of provisions, by reason of the garrisons
and outposts which encompass it on every side. However,
Alençon, with a relieving army, is not far off,
and stores of wine and corn, collected in Picardy, have
been laid up at St. Quentin to supply the famished
town. As to what the end of it will be, no one knows.</p>

<p>The ambassadors, who were expected from Antwerp
for the ratification of the terms of reconciliation, did
not arrive, in consequence of which Alençon returned
to France in high dudgeon with the States of the
Netherlands. Biron is said to be at Antwerp, with
one word and one word only in his mouth, which he
is ever repeating, and that word is ‘money;’ no one
listens to him, for there seems no possibility of extracting
a penny from the townspeople without running
the risk of an outbreak; in good sooth, the funds
which the citizens supplied have so often been wasted
that they are sick of the business.</p>

<p>On the other hand, Orange does what he can to
awake the zeal of Antwerp, but, since Alençon’s disastrous
attempt, his influence has fallen low, and there is
a suspicion abroad that he is more anxious for his own
personal advantage than for the welfare of his country.
Some say he has crossed over to Zealand, to make all
safe in that quarter, and transact some pressing business.</p>

<p>The fall of Dunkirk has been followed by the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">187</a></span>surrender of Nieuport, St. Winoc, and other neighbouring
towns, so that they are in hopes of taking Bruges
and Ypres. Thus affairs in the Netherlands are
mending;<a name="FNanchor_163_163" id="FNanchor_163_163"></a><a href="#Footnote_163_163" class="fnanchor">163</a> and possibly a little skilful management
would induce the people to come to terms. I was
expecting a man from Brabant, who would have given
me accurate information on all these points, but I am
afraid his return will be delayed by the capture of
Dunkirk, which has greatly added to the difficulties of
a sea passage.</p>

<p>There was in Paris a royal messenger, famous for
his skill in conveying to their destination the orders
and despatches of his master; nor was there any one
in whose loyalty and discretion the King placed
greater confidence. His Majesty had ordered him to
cross the Alps with an autograph letter, filling two
sheets, to the Duke of Joyeuse. He had not gone far
before he fell in with four horsemen, who were dogging
his path; they stabbed him in several places, and
carried off the King’s letter; by this means, it is supposed,
several important secrets have been discovered
by the opponents of the Court. Whether it was for
this reason or not I cannot say, but the King immediately
hurried back to Paris, instead of accompanying
his wife to Bourbon-les-bains, as he had intended.
However, in a few days he will join her at the baths,
going on to Lyons, but what he intends to do when he
gets there is a secret to most people.</p>

<p>For myself, I am inclined to think that he wishes
to see whether his presence on the spot will enable
him to turn Montmorency<a name="FNanchor_164_164" id="FNanchor_164_164"></a><a href="#Footnote_164_164" class="fnanchor">164</a> out of the government of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">188</a></span>Languedoc, and place the Duke of Joyeuse, or one of
his other minions, in possession.</p>

<p>I am not, I say, certain that he will give it to the
Duke of Joyeuse, since a most handsome provision
has been made for him in the governorship of Normandy,
which was refused to Alençon himself. But
perhaps ere long we shall learn the truth.</p>

<p>Every one in Paris is talking of the news that Don
Antonio’s new fleet has reached the Azores in safety.
The commander is Monsieur de Chattes, a knight of
Malta, and also a relation of the Duke of Joyeuse,
Admiral of France.</p>

<p>Some time ago one St. Hilaire entered your
Majesty’s service as a gentleman cadet. I understand
he is now serving in Hungary. This young
gentleman’s eldest brother is dead, and, if I mistake
not, he stands next in succession to the estate; there
are several brothers, and, if he is not present when the
property is divided, there is danger of his not getting
his proper share; as the loss to him might be considerable,
his friends have come to the conclusion that
he ought to be summoned home, and have requested
me to write to your Majesty, and ask for an honourable
discharge, which request I hereby comply with. It
will be a good occasion for your Imperial Majesty to
exercise your kindness by graciously giving him leave
of absence for the transaction of private business.</p>

<p>The plague is breaking out afresh in several places,
the wind being unusually steady, and never shifting,
unless it be from south to west.</p>

<p>As to the Greek books, I most humbly repeat my
request that your Majesty would keep the matter in
mind.</p>

<p>There was lately in Paris a gentleman of good
family, who was a notorious duellist. His name was the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">189</a></span>
Baron de Viteaux,<a name="FNanchor_165_165" id="FNanchor_165_165"></a><a href="#Footnote_165_165" class="fnanchor">165</a> and he had attained some celebrity
by the bold and successful way in which he had killed
sundry gentlemen with whom he had differences. The
son of one of his victims was anxious to avenge his
father’s death; he had also another motive, for having
lately been discovered in a plot against the Baron’s
life,<a name="FNanchor_166_166" id="FNanchor_166_166"></a><a href="#Footnote_166_166" class="fnanchor">166</a> he knew that unless he killed him his doom was
sealed. Accordingly he determined to take a decided
course; so last Sunday he invited the Baron to
measure swords with him in a field near Paris; the
arrangement was that they should have in attendance
only one servant apiece, and a gentleman of rank, the
common friend of both parties, to act as umpire and
marshal of the lists; the duel to be with sword and
dagger, no other weapon being allowed, and only to
be terminated when one of the combatants should
have fallen. The Baron accepted the challenge; as
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">190</a></span>soon as they met he ran his opponent through the arm
and stretched him on the ground; not liking to strike
him when he was down, he told him to get up. This
act of kindness cost him dear, for his opponent, in no
way daunted by his wound, but burning to avenge
his fall, with one vigorous and skilful thrust, ran the
Baron through the heart; then, as he lay dying on the
ground, he stabbed him again and again, and thus
rewarded his folly in sparing an antagonist whose arm
still held a sword. Though scarcely twenty-one, the
young man had for years been devoting himself to the
art of fencing, with a view to this meeting. Thus
died the famous Baron, who was looked on here as a
second Mars, and is thought to have frightened the
King<a name="FNanchor_167_167" id="FNanchor_167_167"></a><a href="#Footnote_167_167" class="fnanchor">167</a> more than once. His end was like that of Montal<a name="FNanchor_168_168" id="FNanchor_168_168"></a><a href="#Footnote_168_168" class="fnanchor">168</a>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">191</a></span>and Bussy,<a name="FNanchor_169_169" id="FNanchor_169_169"></a><a href="#Footnote_169_169" class="fnanchor">169</a> both of whom died as they deserved
to die. ‘Aspiciunt oculis superi mortalia justis.’ The
victor is not yet out of danger. He received two
wounds, one, as I mentioned, in his arm, and the
other in his thigh. Even if he recovers, another duel
awaits him, as he will be challenged by a relation of
the late Baron, who is well qualified to avenge his
death.</p>

<p>I thought there was no harm in giving your Majesty
a full account of this affair, though it has but little
connection with my business.</p>

<h3>LETTER XXIII.</h3>

<p class="noindent"><span class="smcap">However</span> famous Africa may have been of old for tales
and wonders, it must yield the palm to modern
France.</p>

<p>Scarcely had our ears recovered from the flood of
gossip aroused by the death of the Baron, which I have
already described, when there crops up another scandal,
calculated to produce quite as much astonishment and
conversation. The King, publicly before a large audience,
gave a severe lecture<a name="FNanchor_170_170" id="FNanchor_170_170"></a><a href="#Footnote_170_170" class="fnanchor">170</a> to his sister the Queen
of Navarre, reproving her for her disreputable and
immoral courses; he gave her the exact dates at which
she had taken on each new lover; he reproached her
with having had a son of whom her husband was not
the father; in each instance his dates and particulars
were so accurate, that one would have thought he had
been an eyewitness. The Queen (Marguerite de Valois)
was overwhelmed, being ashamed to confess, and at
the same time unable to refute, the charges brought
against her. The King concluded his lecture by ordering
her to leave Paris forthwith, and no longer pollute
the city with her presence.</p>

<p>In obedience to this command, the Queen of Navarre
packed in haste, and left Paris on the following
day; no one paid her the attention of escorting her
from the city, and she had not even a complete train of
servants. Her destination is supposed to be Vendôme,
one of her husband’s towns. Two ladies of rank,<a name="FNanchor_171_171" id="FNanchor_171_171"></a><a href="#Footnote_171_171" class="fnanchor">171</a> who
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">193</a></span>are at the head of her household, were arrested on the
road, brought back to Paris, and placed under guard.</p>

<p>Nor was the King satisfied with the punishment he
had inflicted, but must needs write a letter to the King
of Navarre with a full account of his wife’s delinquencies.
People say that, if her husband accepts this
statement, and refuses to receive her, it is the intention
of the King to immure his sister in some
lonely fortress, where she can injure no one by her
immorality and intrigues. Nor need this excite surprise,
for there is some fear that, if she should return
to her husband, and make herself out innocent to him,
she will be the source of much disturbance and disquiet
to the realm; of will and malice for such work she has
good store, and of ability there is enough and to spare.</p>

<p>Immediately after the interview between the King
and his sister, a gentleman, named de Chanvallon,<a name="FNanchor_172_172" id="FNanchor_172_172"></a><a href="#Footnote_172_172" class="fnanchor">172</a> fled
to Germany; for a long time he had stood high in
Alençon’s favour; but when it was discovered that he
had sent news from Antwerp to the French Court,
touching matters which Alençon wished to be suppressed,
he fell out of favour with the Prince, and was
ordered to leave his presence. He returned to Paris
and took refuge with the Queen of Navarre, to the
great annoyance of Alençon, who is now completely
estranged from him, if one may believe what one
hears.</p>

<p>De Chanvallon is a young man whose claims to
noble birth are doubtful; he has, however, the advantage
of pleasing manners, and is a handsome young
fellow; he holds a high place among the admirers of
the Queen of Navarre. They say the Queen Mother
also is greatly incensed with her daughter for her in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">194</a></span>discretions.
How that may be I cannot tell; but at
any rate the Queen of Navarre has, as I told your
Majesty, left Paris, declaring again and again that ‘she
and the Queen of Scots are the most unhappy beings
in the world; a little drop of poison would give her
relief, if anyone would help her to it, but she has
neither friend nor foe to do her this service.’</p>

<p>This story, which is now current in France, is
perhaps hardly deserving of your Majesty’s attention,
or a fit subject for a confidential despatch; but I was
induced to give these details by the circumstance that
I had an opportunity of sending a letter, and the
business of the Queen made it necessary that I should
write to her. So, having little else in the way of
news, I have filled my letter to your Majesty with this
gossip.</p>

<p>The Queen Mother has returned to Alençon at
La Fère. The King himself has set out for Lyons,
his chief object being, as he professes, to meet his dear
Duke of Joyeuse, on his return from Italy.</p>

<p>There is a report that Alençon will marry his niece,
the daughter of his sister and the Duke of Lorraine,
and that the sister of the King of Navarre is intended
for the Duke of Savoy. Strange reports, methinks,
and not worthy of much credit as yet.</p>

<p>The Prince of Parma’s victorious career in Flanders
has been stopped at Ostend; the town was reinforced
by the Prince of Orange, and refused to
surrender. Ypres is lost; Dixmude is said to be hard
pressed, for the people of Bruges were obliged to call
in the garrison of Menin for the further protection of
the town. Menin was evacuated, and left to be plundered
and sacked.</p>

<h3>LETTER XXIV.</h3>

<p class="noindent"><span class="smcap">At</span> last the gentleman whom I expected from the Netherlands,
as I have already told your Majesty, has
returned. The only news he brings is that the Netherlanders
are acting in the maddest way, the citizens
quarrelling, the towns disagreeing, there is no steady
policy, and a reckless spirit prevails. However, in
one point they all agree, to wit, their detestation of the
French; who since the outrage at Antwerp have become
positively hateful to the Netherlanders, a sentiment
which they on their part warmly reciprocate. It is on
account of this feeling, he says, that Biron has returned
with his forces to France. When he was embarking,
there were not enough transports for the conveyance
of the troop horses, so the men piled straw round a
number of them, and burnt them; others they stabbed
or hamstrung, so as to render them useless. Everywhere
Netherlanders are being stopped on the road
and plundered by the French, who tell them that they
are returning the favours they have received in the
Low Countries. All this plainly shows how untrustworthy
is a league between ill-assorted allies, however
much it be varnished over with a pretence of friendship,
and how quickly ancient national feuds break out
afresh.</p>

<p>They say that Puygalliard, commander of the
royal cavalry in Picardy, is acting governor at Cambrai
for the King of France, Alençon having handed
over the city to his brother, and Biron is on his way to
join him.</p>

<p>Apparently Alençon’s plan is to throw a strong
garrison into Cambrai, and retake some places in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">196</a></span>
neighbourhood, while harassing the cities of Hainault
and Artois, and thus proving to the men of Brabant
and the rest of the Netherlanders, who, as he is aware,
hate him cordially, how much protection he could have
afforded, and how much he would have done if they
had continued to cultivate his friendship.</p>

<p>This is supposed to be his only chance of reinstating
himself in their good graces. Towards carrying
out this scheme he has received material assistance,
it is said, from the King, who has appointed him his
Lieutenant; but his powers are so far limited, that he
cannot levy money or draw on the royal treasury at
his own discretion. Still his success is in no way
assured, for the French are so unpopular in the Netherlands,
that the Prince of Orange himself is roundly
abused for supporting their interests; he does not
carry anything like the weight he once possessed; his
influence has declined even among the Hollanders and
Zealanders, who were supposed to be on the point of
making him their Count and Sovereign; now, however,
he is compelled to listen to language from them
which is not merely blunt, but actually rude and insulting.
Some go so far as to insinuate that he was privy
to Alençon’s schemes, when he made his disastrous
attempt on Antwerp.</p>

<p>He is consequently living in retirement at Flushing,
in a position hardly above that of a private gentleman.
Occupied solely with sundry family affairs, he is
quietly waiting till the storm of unpopularity shall have
spent itself, for well he knows how changeable the
masses are, and that neither their favour nor disfavour
is likely to last long.</p>

<p>The following piece of news I give, but do not
vouch for, though the report is generally current.
Those who do not like it explain it away. All France<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">197</a></span>
rings with the story of another defeat at the Azores;<a name="FNanchor_173_173" id="FNanchor_173_173"></a><a href="#Footnote_173_173" class="fnanchor">173</a>
the fleet, they say, is lost; the French cut to pieces;
the Portuguese condemned to the galley and the oar;
the commander of the expedition a prisoner. If this
be true, and it does not seem improbable, France will
have paid dearly for her hospitalities to the Portuguese.</p>

<p>Among other instructions given by the King to
the Duke of Joyeuse, when setting out for Italy, was
one of special importance; he was to obtain the Pope’s
permission for the sale of ecclesiastical property to the
value of some hundred thousands of crowns; it is now
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">198</a></span>reported that the Duke’s attempt to obtain the Papal
sanction was a complete failure. So the King’s hopes
in this quarter were frustrated, and the Duke has not
been more successful than the great men whom the
King lately sent round France to obtain supplies.
The first debates on the King’s return will be, I imagine,
on the best method of scraping up money! With
the lower orders in this country distress has gone so far
that they are like to hang themselves from sheer
despair, consequently they take these frequent and
heavy demands upon their pockets in very bad part.</p>

in great want of many things, especially money, which
in his case is all important. His captains attempted
to surprise Le Quesnoy, a strongly fortified town in
Hainault, and were repulsed with great slaughter.</p>

<p>St. Aldegonde, and a gentleman named Junius,
who acted as secretary to the late Count Palatine,<a name="FNanchor_174_174" id="FNanchor_174_174"></a><a href="#Footnote_174_174" class="fnanchor">174</a> are
said to have come to Cambrai as ambassadors from the
States, to treat with Alençon for a reconciliation; but
treat or reconcile as they please, it is plain they will
not be supported by public sentiment, for the Netherlanders
loathe the very name of Frenchman.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">199</a></span></p>
<p>Ypres is still blockaded by the enemy’s works,
though there is a story that the besiegers have suffered
some loss at the hands of the garrison of
Bruges.</p>

<p>The plague, which is now raging at Paris with
extraordinary violence, will, I think, cause the King
to defer his return. People expect that Alençon will
meet him here.</p>

<p>A new religious fashion<a name="FNanchor_175_175" id="FNanchor_175_175"></a><a href="#Footnote_175_175" class="fnanchor">175</a> is in vogue among the
French. The townsmen and peasants of some place,
of all ages and all ranks, quit their homes in a body,
and make a pilgrimage of two or three days to some
famous shrine. The pilgrims are generally clothed in
white linen robes, and carry crosses in their hands.
Some people think that this movement had its origin
in supernatural warnings, which frightened the people,
and led them to take this means of appeasing the
Deity, and saving themselves; others think that it is
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">200</a></span>to gratify the King that these pilgrimages are undertaken,
and that their object is to ask God to grant
him children.</p>

<h3>LETTER XXVI.</h3>

<p class="noindent"><span class="smcap">I have</span> received a letter from the Counsellors of your
Imperial Majesty’s chamber, in which they state that
the books which I presented to the library some seven
years ago, during the lifetime of the Emperor Maximilian,
of blessed memory, have been valued at one
thousand florins; if your Imperial Majesty regards
this sum in the light of a present in return for my
present of books, I shall consider it most handsome,
and humbly offer my best thanks to your Majesty for
the same; but if it is a matter of business and strict
account—if this sum, I say, is to be reckoned as the
ascertained value of all those precious volumes, the
antiquity of which renders them so important an
acquisition to the Imperial Library—I must confess
that such a price in no way represents their value.
The precious character of the books and the high
regard I have ever felt for them<a name="FNanchor_176_176" id="FNanchor_176_176"></a><a href="#Footnote_176_176" class="fnanchor">176</a> render it incumbent

<h3><a name="xxvii" id="xxvii">LETTER XXVII.</a></h3>

<p class="noindent"><span class="smcap">The</span> King has at last returned. On account of the
plague it was determined that he should not enter
Paris. It was arranged, as the most convenient plan,
that he should stay at Saint-Germain en Laye. On his
arrival, his first care was to summon the gentlemen
who, as I told your Majesty in a former letter, were
sent round the provinces and cities of France to collect
money. They are all men of high standing.<a name="FNanchor_177_177" id="FNanchor_177_177"></a><a href="#Footnote_177_177" class="fnanchor">177</a> The
King will now receive an account of the steps they took
and the reply they got. Their report must needs be
that all made answer with one accord, their burden
was already so heavy, that if they were to bear it any
longer, it must be lightened rather than increased by
the addition of a fresh tax.</p>

<p>This will compel the King to consult these gentlemen
as to the best means of raising funds, for, one
way or another, money must be had. As to what
course they will recommend there is no certainty; but
some people are disposed to think that the honour of
replenishing the treasury will be assigned to the Church.
The King, it seems, desired the Duke of Joyeuse to
open negotiations with the Pope for obtaining his
sanction to a fresh sale of ecclesiastical property to the
value of several hundred thousand crowns; but for
some reason or other nothing came of it.</p>

<p>These conferences at Saint-Germain would have
been brought to a conclusion had not Alençon made a
<em lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">détour</em> to Château Thierry, some 26 miles<a name="FNanchor_178_178" id="FNanchor_178_178"></a><a href="#Footnote_178_178" class="fnanchor">178</a> from Paris,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">202</a></span>on his way from Cambrai to his own town of Angers,
where he intends spending the winter; his mother has
gone to visit him, hoping to bring him to the court, in
order that he may be present at the above-mentioned
conferences; but whether he will be persuaded is still
uncertain, for he persists in his complaint that he has
not been properly supported in the great work he has
undertaken, and that the King has had more regard
for the interests of utter strangers than for those of his
own brother.</p>

<p>As to other matters, Cambrai is neither safe against
attack nor adequately provisioned. Biron tried to
storm Cateau Cambrésis, but, unluckily for him, the
Prince of Parma came to the rescue; the French army
was in great danger, and had to beat a hurried retreat;
Biron, however, managed to save his cannon.</p>

<p>The rebel States of the Netherlands, having met at
Middelburg<a name="FNanchor_179_179" id="FNanchor_179_179"></a><a href="#Footnote_179_179" class="fnanchor">179</a> to transact federal business, the party of
the Prince of Orange urged strongly the advisability
of a reconciliation with Alençon; they were, however,
repeatedly told by other members of the meeting that
the late disastrous affair (at Antwerp) had shown them
how impossible it was to trust the word of Frenchmen.
There were some who wished for the King of Denmark,
while several mentioned Casimir, who had the
support of the Queen of England; but the assembly
broke up without arriving at any decision.</p>

<p class="noindent"><span class="smcap">Alençon</span> has retraced his steps to Laon, whither the

<span class="pagenum2"><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">203</a></span>of this step I am not sure, but probably his object is to
be near Cambrai. It is well known that great disturbances

conspired with officers commanding posts in the

<p class="noindent"><span class="smcap">The</span> Queen Mother has returned from her visit to
Alençon. All her trouble has been to no purpose, for
he could not be induced to accompany her to Court.<a name="FNanchor_180_180" id="FNanchor_180_180"></a><a href="#Footnote_180_180" class="fnanchor">180</a>
The King’s distress at his absence is not overwhelming!</p>

<p>The Queen of Navarre has joined her husband; he
received her courteously, but she will live apart from
him until the truth be ascertained concerning the immoralities
of which she is charged. It is on this business
that Bellièvre has been sent to the King of Navarre.
He is to make a recantation on the King’s behalf, and
reconcile husband and wife.</p>

<p>They say the King has been brought to task for
allowing himself, in a fit of passion, to blast the reputation
of a member of his own family, and is now sorry
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">204</a></span>for what he has done.<a name="FNanchor_181_181" id="FNanchor_181_181"></a><a href="#Footnote_181_181" class="fnanchor">181</a> He tries to clear himself by
saying that in a rash moment he believed what certain
people told him. The King of Navarre demands that,
if his wife be guilty, she should receive the punishment
she deserves; but that, if she has been falsely accused,
and is innocent, her calumniators should pay the penalty.
It is well known that the King was provoked into this
by the murder of the messenger<a name="FNanchor_182_182" id="FNanchor_182_182"></a><a href="#Footnote_182_182" class="fnanchor">182</a> he sent to the Duke
of Joyeuse, of which I informed your Majesty in a
former letter, for he suspected that his sister had been
privy to the assassination. Those who are acquainted
with the character of the lady say that, unless they are
greatly mistaken, she will one day signally avenge the
insult she has received.</p>

<p>The story of a disturbance at Cambrai, which I
mentioned at the end of my last letter, arose from the
Seigneur de Goigny, commandant of a neighbouring
place for the King (of Spain), being seen in the city.
It was assumed that he could not be staying in Cambrai
without the consent of the townsmen. The assumption
was ill-grounded, as the event proved, for he
had come to Cambrai to have an interview with Alençon,
whom he has followed to France; for aught I
know, he is still at his quarters.</p>

<p>The reason of his visit was the hope that had been
thrown out of some arrangement for recovering Cambrai,
a large sum of money having been promised to
Alençon on behalf of the King of Spain.</p>

<p>The ruined and impoverished condition of the
nobles in Alençon’s train renders it by no means im<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">205</a></span>probable
that this scheme may come to something, as
it would provide the means to save them from starvation
and destitution; but in the Royal Court, and
throughout France, the negotiation is held to be most
discreditable, and is regarded as a striking proof of the
fickleness of the French.</p>

<p>A report is current that the King has written a
letter to his brother cautioning him. An arrangement
for the exchange of prisoners furnishes the pretext
under which this negotiation is being conducted.</p>

<p>In spite of all this, some are inclined to think that
the States of Brabant are getting ready a fresh embassy,
which will shortly be sent to arrange the terms
of a reconciliation with Alençon. It would appear
that they have been driven to this course by the successes
of the Prince of Parma, who has seized nearly
all the country save Ghent and Antwerp. The
Netherlanders, however, have opened the dykes with
the double object of protecting themselves, and making
Parma’s conquests of no avail to him. It is supposed
that their next step will be to send a fresh embassy,
since they are determined to suffer the worst that may
befall, rather than submit once more to the authority of
Spain. However this may be, there is news that the
Zealanders and Hollanders will shortly appoint Orange
as their Count.</p>

<p>De Puygaillard has left Cambrai; de Balagny<a name="FNanchor_183_183" id="FNanchor_183_183"></a><a href="#Footnote_183_183" class="fnanchor">183</a> is in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">206</a></span>command of the citadel and garrison, and he is not the
sort of man to surrender the town to anyone, even
though Alençon himself should give the order. The
latter has changed his plans; it is thought he will
not go, as formerly reported, to Angers for the winter,
but will stop in his present quarters at Château
Thierry. He has returned from the Netherlands with
such discredit that he is only thinking of where he
may best hide his dishonoured head. Meanwhile the
King is holding his assemblies, which will continue
sitting for at least two months; not only will the
financial question be considered, but also a general
reform of all abuses; it is the purpose of the King, in
conformity with his present strict religious views, to
correct all vices and faults in the administration of his
realm and thus promote the welfare of his people; it
is probable, however, that the upshot of these changes
will be to make the King’s interest the paramount
consideration. For instance, the Crown claims the
right of conferring Church patronage, and in consequence
you may see children, military men,<a name="FNanchor_184_184" id="FNanchor_184_184"></a><a href="#Footnote_184_184" class="fnanchor">184</a> and women
holding bishopricks and abbacies; well, first there
was a debate as to the advisability of replacing matters
on their old footing, and making these appointments
elective, but a resolution was passed that, inasmuch as
the old purity in voting had passed away, and all principle
had been lost, there appeared no reason for
depriving the Crown of the valuable right it had
acquired, and that the matter had better be left on its
present footing, with the understanding that the King,
when exercising his patronage, should have regard to
the character and qualifications of the candidates. In
many other cases there will be a similar result—that
is, projects will be ushered in with fine phrases as to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">207</a></span>the <em>interests of the people</em> and the mitigation of their
burdens, and then in the end the <em>interests of the Crown</em>
will carry the day. The King indeed takes care that
the law he enacted with regard to dress should be
strictly observed; it had not been in force many days
when it met with the usual fate of such edicts, and was
disregarded by the Parisians, whereon his Majesty
sent the Provost of the Court into the city with orders
to throw into jail all persons whom he might find
transgressing the law. There were several arrests
both of men and women, and a great commotion was
the consequence, amounting almost to an insurrection.
‘Were they to be arrested by the Provost as if they
were highwaymen or burglars? They had their own
judges and magistrates to punish offending citizens.
If the Provost<a name="FNanchor_185_185" id="FNanchor_185_185"></a><a href="#Footnote_185_185" class="fnanchor">185</a> continued to interfere it should cost
him his life.’ It seemed likely that the people would
be as good as their word, so the magistrates of the
city came to the King and informed him of what was
going on; at first he took them roundly to task for
their laches in allowing these salutary laws to fall into
abeyance, telling them that it was through their negligence
he had been driven to other means of enforcing
them; he then hurried to Paris, went straight to the
prison and set free all who had been arrested on this
charge, paying out of his own purse the jailor’s dues
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">208</a></span>for each prisoner. Since then the law has been more
strictly enforced.</p>

<p>Cardinal de Birague<a name="FNanchor_186_186" id="FNanchor_186_186"></a><a href="#Footnote_186_186" class="fnanchor">186</a> is dead, at the age, if I mistake
not, of more than eighty years; the Court followed
its usual fashion, and gave a magnificent funeral
at death to one whom it loved not during his life.
He held the title of Chancellor of France, but the
duties of his office were discharged by a deputy; he
was a man who loved fair dealing, and consequently a
good friend and supporter of the Queen Dowager of
France, your Imperial Majesty’s sister; his successor<a name="FNanchor_187_187" id="FNanchor_187_187"></a><a href="#Footnote_187_187" class="fnanchor">187</a>
is his exact opposite in character, disposition, and intentions.</p>

<p>Orange is scheming to recover Zutphen, a city of
Gueldres, which has been taken by the Spaniards. The
Count of Gueldres is suspected of having a secret understanding
with Parma; there is a report that he has been
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">209</a></span>sent as a prisoner to Zealand with his children. At
Ghent also a conspiracy<a name="FNanchor_188_188" id="FNanchor_188_188"></a><a href="#Footnote_188_188" class="fnanchor">188</a> of some nobles against the
city authorities has been detected through Imbize, who
for a long time was an exile in the Palatinate; this discovery
has placed them all in imminent danger; among
the number is Ryhove, who was ambassador at Constantinople.</p>

<p>However the others may fare, Champagny, who
was the prime mover and soul of the plot, can hardly
hope to save his head.</p>

<p class="noindent"><span class="smcap">Nothing</span> of importance, as far as I know, has happened
since I last wrote, unless it be that some men were
caught at Alençon’s quarters, with arms in their hands,
under suspicious circumstances; it was thought that
they were waiting to assassinate some one. Alençon
was strongly impressed with the idea that they were
cut-throats hired to murder him. At last, after a careful
investigation, it was discovered that it was not his
life they designed to take, but Fervaques’; moreover,
it was ascertained that the man who set them on was
at open feud with the latter, on account of some injury
he had received at his hands.</p>

<p>The Queen Mother has again set out on a visit to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">210</a></span>Alençon. She has several objects in going, but the
chief one is to remove whatever suspicions he may still
entertain. People say Alençon is also about to receive
ambassadors from nearly all the rebel States of the
Netherlands, with the exception of Flanders, which
has not yet been induced to sanction his recall. For
the aforesaid ambassadors, whose arrival is expected,
eighteen gold chains are being worked up at Alençon’s
quarters. The Hollanders, however, are supposed to
have already sworn allegiance to Orange, or to be on
the point of so doing, with the reservation that the
supreme sovereignty be vested in Alençon. Whatever
else Orange may lose, he will always retain his power
of perpetuating disturbances and revolutions. His
chief assistant and adviser, St. Aldegonde, has been
made burgomaster of Antwerp. For many years past
I have been unable to see any prospect of a peaceful
settlement for the Netherlands. Parma has, it is true,
done much, but I doubt whether there is not quite as
much more to be done.</p>

<p>We have news of disturbances in Gascony and
Aquitaine; in both of these provinces places have
been seized, and attempts are being made to recover
them by force of arms.</p>

<p class="noindent"><span class="smcap">The</span> King is bent on a plan for reforming his life, and
devoting himself more exclusively to religion. It was
supposed that he would spend the Carnival at Paris;<span class="pagenum2"><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">211</a></span>
he used to say that not to be at Paris at that season
was as bad as being in Poland, for he should miss all
the fun and pleasure of the capital, and last, but not
least, the society of certain ladies whom he had been
accustomed to meet on that occasion.<a name="FNanchor_189_189" id="FNanchor_189_189"></a><a href="#Footnote_189_189" class="fnanchor">189</a></p>

<p>In his present humour he does not care to leave
Saint-Germain, where he lives like a hermit. Meanwhile
the assembly, which was convened for the purpose of
reforming the people and remedying abuses in the
government, is still sitting. Every day it passes a
number of wholesome measures, of which I shall now
proceed to give your Majesty an example. There is
no greater burden laid on the realm of France than
the multiplication of official posts, which the King
creates to the benefit of his own pocket and the impoverishment
of his people; these are now, to a great
extent, abolished. For instance, the King had as
many as 150 chamberlains, all of whom are now dismissed,
with the exception of sixteen, or, according to
another version, twenty-four. The same course, it is
supposed, will be followed in all similar cases, to the
great advantage and relief of the nation, on whose
shoulders the entire burden of supporting these sinecures
used to rest.</p>

<p>This reform, however, will draw complaints from
individuals who have purchased such offices with hard
cash out of their own pockets. Their claims, it is
true, will be commuted, but they will suffer great inconvenience
and loss by the change.</p>

<p>Meantime there is a vague idea that France is on
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">212</a></span>the eve of a fresh civil war, and there are people who
assert that Navarre has sent to Germany to hire reiters.
Whether that be so or not, at any rate the King is
raising troops.</p>

<p>It is supposed that the Queen of Navarre will
shortly be reconciled to her husband, if indeed the
reconciliation has not already taken place, through the
mediation of one Pernantius of Lorraine, a notable
champion of Protestantism. The Netherland ambassadors
are now with Alençon, waiting for fuller instructions
from the States. Alençon is urging his
claim to be appointed Lieutenant-General of the kingdom,
with the same powers as the present Sovereign
held during the reign of his brother Charles, which were
very extensive; but the King objects, and it seems
hardly likely that they will come to terms. This difference,
it is feared, will, in the event of war, be the
source of yet more serious quarrels.</p>

<p>Every day men<a name="FNanchor_190_190" id="FNanchor_190_190"></a><a href="#Footnote_190_190" class="fnanchor">190</a> are coming over from England
to France who have been concerned in the great conspiracy
against the life of the Queen (Elizabeth). The
Earl of Norfolk<a name="FNanchor_191_191" id="FNanchor_191_191"></a><a href="#Footnote_191_191" class="fnanchor">191</a> has been arrested in England for
his part in the plot, and everyone expects that he will
lose his head, but the Earl of Arundel’s case is not regarded
as equally desperate, as the Queen seems more
inclined to show him mercy. Even the Queen of
Scots, who is accused of having been privy to all their
designs, is considered to be in great danger. The
Ambassador<a name="FNanchor_192_192" id="FNanchor_192_192"></a><a href="#Footnote_192_192" class="fnanchor">192</a> of the King of Spain, they say, was the
prime mover in the conspiracy, and on this account
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">213</a></span>has been ordered to leave England. There is an idea
that he will pass through France on his way to Spain.</p>

the King in a most respectful and submissive
manner, insomuch that for some time he kept his
knee well nigh touching the ground. When raised by
the King, he commenced his address by imploring forgiveness
for any offences he might have committed
against him.</p>

<p>The King replied there was no need of pardon;
he was quite aware that in certain points he did not
agree with his brother, but for his own part he was
prepared to submit such questions to the arbitration of
their mother, and would abide by her decision.</p>

<p>People say that Alençon was advised to make sure
of Joyeuse and Epernon, through whose eyes the
King sees everything, if he wanted his brother to help
his party, and interfere in the affairs of the Netherlands.
The King could be led to anything, if they chose to
exert their influence. This advice he seems inclined to
adopt.</p>

the right of placing garrisons in any of their cities

They have also been to Paris to plead their cause before
the King.</p>

<p>Alençon, after spending a few days with the King,
returned to his old quarters at Château Thierry, with
the intention of coming again to Paris before Easter.</p>

<p>When he left the whole court escorted him out;
there was a great fuss, and none so forward as Joyeuse
and Epernon, on whom he bestowed every mark of
favour at parting.</p>

<p>The King, it seems, is about to take Cambrai under
his protection, and will send some troops thither, which,
however, are nominally to be Alençon’s.</p>

<p>Everyone is talking of the campaign against Damville,
whose present title is the Duke of Montmorency.<a name="FNanchor_194_194" id="FNanchor_194_194"></a><a href="#Footnote_194_194" class="fnanchor">194</a>
He is Governor of Languedoc, and appointments of
this kind are held for life, and not for a term of years,
the holder not being superseded unless he has become
a rebel or been convicted of high treason. The King is
determined to bestow the governorship of the province
on the father of Joyeuse, but Montmorency, it seems,
does not intend surrendering his post as long as there is
life in his body. The King has caused Montmorency to
be tried before his Parliament, and pronounced contumacious
and rebellious. This campaign, people say,
will be taken in hand after Easter. Alençon is to act
as the King’s Lieutenant in proof of his submission to
the royal authority. The result is anxiously expected.</p>

<p>Montmorency has great resources in Languedoc,
and is supported by a united and numerous party.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">215</a></span>Many will suspect that his downfall will pave the way
to their destruction.</p>

<p>A few days ago the King was within an ace of
committing an act in his own council-chamber hardly
consistent with the gracious character which befits a
Sovereign. Among his councillors was a knight of
Malta, the Prior of Champagne,<a name="FNanchor_195_195" id="FNanchor_195_195"></a><a href="#Footnote_195_195" class="fnanchor">195</a> a violent and reckless
man. The King was speaking earnestly on some important
point, and the Prior, who took an opposite
view, went so far as to say, ‘If you wished,<a name="FNanchor_196_196" id="FNanchor_196_196"></a><a href="#Footnote_196_196" class="fnanchor">196</a> Sire,
to speak the truth, you must remember, &amp;c.’ The
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">216</a></span>King took his words as a personal insult, and was
furious. ‘What?’ cried he; ‘do you think I am telling
a lie? Down on your knees at once, and beg my
pardon.’ When he had done so, the King forgave him,
but at the same time ordered him out of his sight.
When the Prior was somewhat slow in obeying, or, it
may be, said something in reply, the King again lost
his temper, and, drawing his sword, was on the point
of running him through, when he was held back by the
gentlemen present. The Bishop of Paris<a name="FNanchor_197_197" id="FNanchor_197_197"></a><a href="#Footnote_197_197" class="fnanchor">197</a> is still
suffering from a wound in the hand, which he received
in grasping the naked blade. Thus the King in his
council-chamber all but perpetrated a crime little becoming
his character as a ‘penitent.’ Several people
interceded for the Prior, and the King accordingly
pardoned him, but at the same time required him to
leave the Court and enter his presence no more—a
severe punishment to a man who is court bred, and
knows no pleasure elsewhere.</p>

<p>The Ambassador, who is said to have been an accomplice
in the English tragedy, Don Bernardino de
Mendoza, has arrived at Paris, where he is waiting
for an answer from the King of Spain, but on what
business I cannot say. Some think he is seeking the
post of ambassador at the French court.</p>

<p class="noindent"><span class="smcap">When</span> the people from Flanders saw that they made
no way with Alençon, and all hope of help from France
was at an end, they returned home, reversed their
policy, and opened negotiations with Parma.<a name="FNanchor_199_199" id="FNanchor_199_199"></a><a href="#Footnote_199_199" class="fnanchor">199</a> Their
ambassadors were entertained courteously by the
Prince, and received presents from him on leaving,
while the envoys whom Parma sent with his reply
had like treatment from the town of Ghent.</p>

<p>Very different is the feeling at Antwerp, where the
citizens will endure the worst sooner than submit to the
old yoke, and have therefore determined to cast in their
lot with Zealand and Holland for weal or woe. This
new combination will prolong the war, as they are the
wealthiest people in the world, are girt with fortifications,
and have the keys of the sea in their possession.</p>

<p>The rest of the towns of Brabant are supposed to
be on the eve of returning to their allegiance to the
King of Spain, in company with Flanders; the men
of Antwerp do not object, as they wish to be relieved
of the obligation. Bergen, which the Hollanders have
taken under their protection, is the only exception.
Alençon indeed has something else to think of just now
besides the affairs of the Netherlands, aye, and something
that touches him more closely, for there is a report
that he is in a decline, which has reached the con<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">218</a></span>sumptive
stage. If this be true—and it is generally believed—he
cannot be long for this world, and then,
however little the House of Valois may like it, the
Bourbons will be the heirs presumptive to the Crown—first
the Cardinal, and then Navarre. The Queen
Mother is staying in the country at some distance from
Paris, and the report is that she is ill from grief. The
King, it seems, has laid aside the idea of a campaign
against Damville,<a name="FNanchor_200_200" id="FNanchor_200_200"></a><a href="#Footnote_200_200" class="fnanchor">200</a> of which every one was talking, and
has issued a proclamation to the effect that there is
nothing he loves so much as peace, no one is to rise in
arms, all are to do their best to prevent an outbreak.
This Edict is construed by the opposite faction to mean
exactly the reverse, and to be proof positive that war
is intended; they say this is his usual trick when he
means to attack them.</p>

him save one or two of his adherents, who encourage
him to hope that he will recover, but impartial people
consider his case desperate; while some think he is
already dead, but that his death is kept secret.</p>

<p>The greatest anxiety is felt throughout France, and
it is indeed a critical time, for Alençon’s death will be
a most serious matter to the kingdom. For some time
past the King has been estranged from his wife; people
trace this estrangement to the rivalry between the Duke
of Mercœur, brother to the Queen, and the Duke of
Joyeuse, husband to the Queen’s sister. The latter has
been appointed by the King Admiral of France with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">220</a></span>
very extensive powers; while the Duke of Mercœur
has been made Governor of Brittany. Now the Duke
of Mercœur maintains that all appointments within the
limits of his province belong to him, and Joyeuse disputes
his claim. The King on being informed of this
difference spoke sharply to the Duke of Mercœur, and
from that time forth his manner to his wife has been
less kind, from an idea that the Duke of Mercœur
would not be so proud and stubborn, if it were not for
his sister’s countenance and support. This has given
rise to a notion on the part of some people, that the
King is thinking of divorcing his wife, on the plea
that she is barren, it being most important, under
present circumstances, that children should be born
to the King of France.</p>

<p>The Duke of Epernon has been sent into Aquitaine
with a numerous and splendid retinue; his mission
is a mystery and has furnished much material for
conversation and conjecture; only one or two, besides
the King, being acquainted with the secret.<a name="FNanchor_202_202" id="FNanchor_202_202"></a><a href="#Footnote_202_202" class="fnanchor">202</a> The
King also himself, they say, is intending to visit Lyons
shortly; no doubt there is some important reason for
this visit, but what it may be, there is no one who can
explain with such accuracy and clearness as Time!</p>

<h3>LETTER XXXVIII.</h3>

<p class="noindent"><span class="smcap">That</span> Alençon’s case was desperate has been proved
by his death. He breathed his last on the tenth of
this month, almost at the same hour and minute as his
brother Charles some years ago; it is certain that he
died of the same complaint, tubercular consumption, as
your Imperial Majesty will have already learnt from
the King’s own letter.</p>

<p>Some people declare<a name="FNanchor_203_203" id="FNanchor_203_203"></a><a href="#Footnote_203_203" class="fnanchor">203</a> his death is a far greater
benefit to the world than his birth; they say he had
fallen under the influence of worthless satellites, and
was incapable of distinguishing between friends and
flatterers; he made notoriety his object, but the notoriety
he sought might more correctly be described as
infamy; he lightly undertook, and yet more lightly
abandoned that which he had undertaken. His life
was in accordance with his character; fickle, unstable,
restless, his one great object was to destroy concord
and promote disorder. His mother’s grief for him is
genuine, the tears of the rest are constrained tears, I
fancy, and their sorrow a sham. A magnificent funeral,
people say, is being prepared, but the mourning will
not last beyond St. John’s Day, which is now near at
hand. The corpse is to come to Paris. The King has
put on black; this is unusual, for on former occasions
it has been the custom for Kings of France to wear
violet when in mourning. Some prognosticate that
Alençon’s death will give rise to great changes in
France, and I think they are not far wrong, for the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">222</a></span>chief provinces and cities of the kingdom will not be
disposed to accept any Sovereign whose religion differs
from theirs, neither will they lack leaders when they
rise, for the governors of the provinces will come
forward, and others to boot.</p>

<p>Some take such a hopeless and gloomy view of the
future, that they are already thinking of emigrating.
The King indeed is heaping honours on Navarre;<a name="FNanchor_204_204" id="FNanchor_204_204"></a><a href="#Footnote_204_204" class="fnanchor">204</a> he
has presented him with the duchy of Alençon, and in
his letters gives him the title of distinction which is by
custom assigned to the heir presumptive to the throne;<a name="FNanchor_205_205" id="FNanchor_205_205"></a><a href="#Footnote_205_205" class="fnanchor">205</a>
moreover, a way has been discovered of perpetuating
the miseries of the Netherlands in spite of Alençon’s
removal, for they say he has bequeathed Cambrai<a name="FNanchor_206_206" id="FNanchor_206_206"></a><a href="#Footnote_206_206" class="fnanchor">206</a> to
his mother; this legacy will probably carry with it all
his other acquisitions in the Netherlands, and his interests
in that quarter; it is thought that the Queen
Mother will make all this bequest over to Navarre. In
this way she will be able to carry out all her schemes
in the Netherlands, without giving the King of Spain
ground for complaint against the King of France.
Meanwhile Cambrai is a thorn in the side of Artois
and Hainault, for the garrison pursues its forays far
and wide, burning and harrying the country.</p>

<p>The town of Bruges has received a garrison of the
troops of the King of Spain; Ghent has admitted
Orange’s forces, but there was such want of forage
that shortly afterwards the cavalry were obliged to
leave. People have a notion that the departure of the
cavalry may lead the men of Ghent to resume their
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">223</a></span>negotiations with Parma; another reason assigned is
the alarm inspired by the arrival of the Spanish reinforcements.</p>

<h3>LETTER XXXIX.</h3>

<p class="noindent"><span class="smcap">On</span> the festival of St. John and the two following days
the last rites were paid to Alençon; there was nothing
in the ceremonies to call for remark, except that in the
funeral speech no mention was made of his connection
with the Netherlands, nor were the banners of any of
the provinces of the Low Countries introduced into
the procession. I have appended to my letter a copy
of what is commonly supposed to be Alençon’s will.</p>

<p>To his Majesty’s great delight, the King of Navarre
treated the Duke of Epernon, on his arrival,
with every mark of consideration and honour; but
Navarre’s wife (Marguerite de Valois) refused to admit
him to her presence. Epernon is supposed to be
going through the province of Narbonne, and so to
Lyons, where the King will meet him.</p>

<p>Marshal de Retz is busy in Picardy strengthening
the garrisons of forts and towns, where needful, so that
they may be ready in case of attack or sudden emergency.
Strong bodies of infantry and cavalry are being
stationed in different parts of the country, with the
object, as I suppose, of having a relieving army at
hand in case Cambrai shall be hard pressed. The Hollanders
and Zealanders have raised a fleet to prevent
any supplies being introduced into those ports of the
Netherlands which are in the occupation of their adversaries,
and this will probably cause a rise in the
price of corn.</p>

<p class="noindent"><span class="smcap">The</span> Netherland ambassadors are trying hard to
induce the King to give them his support. This is
the only fact worth recording in my present letter.
Their appeal is strongly supported by the Queen
Mother, and her influence is said to have had some
weight with the King. One of the ambassadors has
been sent back to the Netherlands in company with
the gentleman<a name="FNanchor_210_210" id="FNanchor_210_210"></a><a href="#Footnote_210_210" class="fnanchor">210</a> who was formerly Alençon’s representative
at Antwerp.</p>

<p>They are the bearers, people say, of a favourable
answer to the States from the King, promising to give
them advice, countenance, and reinforcements with a
liberal hand. The terms which the States offer in
return are extravagant, and almost past belief. The
result of the negotiations is awaited with the deepest
interest. Some people are sounding the war-note right
lustily. What, say they, would the King wait for, or
what better opportunity could he find for commencing
a struggle which must inevitably come before
many years are out? Why does not he take the
initiative, when such an opportunity and such advantages
are placed within his reach? It is folly to
keep longing for that which it is in one’s power to possess.
Granted, that the Netherlanders at the bottom
of their hearts distrust the French, and will not submit
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">226</a></span>to them, still, is it a small advantage to withdraw them
from their allegiance to their ancient lord? Let them
live in a state of semi-independence, and not as subjects
of France, so long as they remain the bitterest
foes of Spain. Assuredly the estranging of so many
provinces will be a heavy blow to the King of Spain,
even if the King of France should not succeed in subjecting
them to himself. No sensible man can fail to
see that the Spaniards, who are naturally greedy of
empire, when they have consolidated their position,
will not allow their vast powers to lie dormant, but
will endeavour to make themselves masters of the
whole of Christendom. But how little remains for
them to win, compared with what they have already
secured! Henceforth there will be no liberty in Europe,
and all other princes and states will be placed in a
humiliating position. Everything will depend on the
pleasure of the Spaniard—a most miserable and degrading
prospect! No time, therefore, must be lost in
encountering this attack on the liberties of Europe,
before the Spanish power is consolidated. There is
no doubt that all kings, princes, and states who have
any regard for their own safety and reputation would
gladly join their forces and unite in extinguishing a
conflagration which is dangerous to everyone.<a name="FNanchor_211_211" id="FNanchor_211_211"></a><a href="#Footnote_211_211" class="fnanchor">211</a></p>

<p>My own opinion is that these views are popular,
and that they are only waiting for the death of the
King of Spain, as the most favourable opportunity for
a general movement.</p>

<p>Parma has transferred his camp from Lillo to Dendermonde,
after great losses, if we may believe the
report. He retains, however, the fort of Calloo, which
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">227</a></span>enables him to cause much trouble to the ships as they
sail by. They hope to take Dendermonde<a name="FNanchor_212_212" id="FNanchor_212_212"></a><a href="#Footnote_212_212" class="fnanchor">212</a> without
much difficulty, as the larger part of the garrison has
been cut off from the town.</p>

<p>Marshal de Retz is at St. Quentin, and trying hard
to induce Balagny,<a name="FNanchor_213_213" id="FNanchor_213_213"></a><a href="#Footnote_213_213" class="fnanchor">213</a> the governor of Cambrai, to surrender
the town to the King and the King’s nominee.
Balagny’s tyrannical conduct has rendered him most
unpopular at Cambrai, and there are hopes that some
arrangement may be made. Marshal de Retz has
proved himself a skilful and sagacious diplomatist in
affairs of this kind.</p>

<p class="noindent"><span class="smcap">I have</span> hardly any news, and yet I feel I ought not to
allow a longer time to elapse before writing.</p>

<p>The King has returned from Lyons without achieving
anything worth notice, as far as I know. He stayed
for some time at the castle of <em lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">le Bois de Vincennes</em>,
in the neighbourhood of Paris, where he is building a
church, to be held by the order of St. Jerome, for the
benefit of himself and his society of Penitents.<a name="FNanchor_214_214" id="FNanchor_214_214"></a><a href="#Footnote_214_214" class="fnanchor">214</a> At
the same time he is carrying on his campaign against
vice by punishing heinous offences, especially those
which are connected with malversation of public moneys,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">228</a></span>whether they belong to the privy purse or the exchequer,
France being full of offenders of this kind.</p>

<p>In dealing with these matters he does not spare
even men of high rank; consequently there is a panic,
and people are leaving the country. He will next
attack the Parliaments, it is supposed, and require
them to give an account of the way they have administered
justice, and the sentences they have pronounced,
for these courts of justice are, it is considered, full of
corruption and in great need of reform. In France the
Parliaments have powers almost equal to the King’s;
in them justice is sold, or given as a matter of favour.</p>

<p>Though well stricken in years,<a name="FNanchor_215_215" id="FNanchor_215_215"></a><a href="#Footnote_215_215" class="fnanchor">215</a> the Cardinal de
Bourbon is apparently unwilling to surrender the right
of succession to the throne to his nephew Navarre, and
therefore inclines to the Guises, whom a numerous party
regard as their leaders; nay, a little while ago it was
stated that he intended to resign his orders, surrender
his Cardinal’s hat, and marry the widow of Montpensier,
sister to the Duke of Guise. The report is still
current.</p>

<p>Marshal de Retz is still in Picardy, strengthening
fortifications and garrisoning posts, for the Queen
Mother has, it appears, set her mind on keeping Cambrai,
and some of the household troops have been despatched
thither with that object. The Queen herself
has left Paris for the banks of the Loire, and is going
from place to place in the hope of arranging an interview
with Navarre, but the probability of his meeting
her is not great, as he is afraid of treachery, and will
not trust either her or the King. That his wife may
meet her mother is not impossible. The King too has
set out for the Loire, and will stop some time, should
the plague, which keeps him from Paris, allow him to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229">229</a></span>remain. At Paris it is still doubtful as to what the
King’s destination really is.</p>

<p>Matters in the Netherlands have taken a turn very
favourable to the King of Spain. Ghent<a name="FNanchor_216_216" id="FNanchor_216_216"></a><a href="#Footnote_216_216" class="fnanchor">216</a> has made
its peace with him. If report says true, the terms are
as follows: they are to pay him 200,000 crowns, restore
the churches, allow two citadels to be built,
and give up any six men who may be demanded.</p>

<p>Moreover, the men of Brussels are also talking of
surrender. In spite of this Antwerp does not lose
heart, nor are the Hollanders and Zealanders abandoning
any part of their programme. The Queen Mother’s
Ambassador has arrived from the Netherlands, and
talks much of the highly favourable terms on which
they are willing to conclude a bargain with the King
of France. The result is doubtful. Meantime, that
God Almighty may preserve your Imperial Majesty
is the prayer of your humble servant.</p>

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230">230</a></span>however, gave him notice to quit by carrying off one
of the ladies of the Queen’s bedchamber, so after all he
has returned to Saint-Germain en Laye, where he intends
prosecuting his social and legal reforms. I saw
him at Blois, whither I went to express to him and the
two Queens, his mother and his wife, the grief and
sorrow of the Most Christian Queen, your Majesty’s
sister, at the death of Alençon.</p>

<p>There was some talk of disturbances in the south of
France, but they seem to have subsided.</p>

<p>Don Bernardino de Mendoza, whom I mentioned as
travelling from England to Spain by way of Paris, has
returned to these parts. He comes to express his
master’s grief at the death of Alençon, and also to
supersede Tassis<a name="FNanchor_218_218" id="FNanchor_218_218"></a><a href="#Footnote_218_218" class="fnanchor">218</a> as ambassador to France. Tassis
has gone to the Netherlands <em lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">en route</em> for Spain. If
laying out large sums be the proof of a good ambassador,
Don Bernardino must be the best in the world,
for they say he intends spending as much as 16,000
crowns a year. I hope the rest may be in keeping,
and that he may prove in every way as good as
Tassis.</p>

<p>The Duke of Epernon, who is the King’s second
self, is ill with a severe attack of scrofula, a disease
which the Kings of France profess to heal by a touch

of putting his power to the test! I write this because
I have nothing else to say. Everything is at a standstill
from the frost, but this pause will probably lead
to greater movements in the spring.</p>

hand over to him twelve towns in which his authority
shall be supreme; they promise to contribute 100,000
crowns a month towards the expenses of the war, one-half
to be paid by themselves, and the other by the
Queen of England. An English ambassador is expected
here, with a large and numerous train, to take
part in these negotiations; the ostensible object of the
embassy is to convey the Order of the Garter to the
King of France. Meantime the Netherland ambassadors
have been ordered to stop short at a neighbouring
town,<a name="FNanchor_220_220" id="FNanchor_220_220"></a><a href="#Footnote_220_220" class="fnanchor">220</a> but for all that they are treating with
the King by means of letters and memorials; their
expenses are defrayed by the French treasury. They
assure the King of an easy success, if he will only cut off
the enemy’s supplies by stopping all exports from
France. If this is done, they declare that in a year’s
time there will not be a single foreign soldier in the
Netherlands, for the Spaniards must needs be starved
out, their supplies by sea being already cut off; even
now, they say, though there is nothing to interrupt
their communications with France, provisions in the
enemy’s camp are scarce and dear. What the King’s
decision will be it is hard to say. If he shall espouse
their cause, he will thereby involve himself in a serious
war; if he helps rebels against their Sovereign, he
supplies the rebels in his own kingdom with an awkward
precedent; lastly, he must take up arms for
heretics, when he hates and loathes the heretics in his
own realm, and endures them only because he cannot
help himself. Such a policy would be inconsistent;
but, however that may be, he will not, people think,
openly espouse the cause of the Netherlanders, the
ostensible leadership in the war being assigned to the
<span class="pagenum2"><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233">233</a></span>Queen Mother, while the King is to support her with
his forces, and countenance the undertaking; but as to
who is to have the conduct of the campaign is more
than I can make out. The King of Navarre or Condé
would, it is true, be well qualified for the post, but
neither of them will place himself in the King’s power,
as they have not forgotten the wedding and massacre
of Saint Bartholomew; notwithstanding, some say that
Navarre will give the hand of his sister, who is the
sole heir of his kingdom, to Condé, with the view to
securing his own safety, as well as the Prince’s, since in
that case, if either of them be murdered, there will be a
survivor to avenge his death.<a name="FNanchor_221_221" id="FNanchor_221_221"></a><a href="#Footnote_221_221" class="fnanchor">221</a> The decision arrived at

<p class="noindent"><span class="smcap">The</span> King has granted a private audience to the Netherland
ambassadors; I cannot give the terms of their
address, but it is easy to guess what they were. As
to the King, they say, he replied that he would not
fail in his duty as a good neighbour. The ambassadors
are fifteen in number, and their retinue comprises some
sixty gentlemen; they have been joined by the Prince
of Espinoy,<a name="FNanchor_223_223" id="FNanchor_223_223"></a><a href="#Footnote_223_223" class="fnanchor">223</a> who, with his brother, the Marquis of
Richebourg, was for some time resident at the Court
of the late Emperor Maximilian.</p>

<p>It is generally reported that ambassadors, or at
any rate despatches, are also coming from the King of
Spain, the Pope, and the Duke of Savoy, to remind
the King of his engagements and to call on him to
fulfil them; but, for my own part, I incline to think
that neither letters nor ambassadors from the King of
Spain or Duke of Savoy will have much influence; as
to how much weight will be attached to the Pope’s
remonstrance, I cannot say. The expenses of the
Netherland ambassadors are being defrayed by the
French treasury. Lastly, the English Ambassador,
who was expected, has arrived with a numerous and
gallant following. His name is the Earl of Derby<a name="FNanchor_224_224" id="FNanchor_224_224"></a><a href="#Footnote_224_224" class="fnanchor">224</a>;
he is of royal blood the French say, and the English
confirm the statement. He was met and escorted into
Paris with the utmost pomp; a house next the Palace
was appointed for his use, and 200 crowns a day
assigned for his expenses. He is the bearer of the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_235" id="Page_235">235</a></span>Order of the Garter from the Queen to the King of
France. This is the ostensible object of his mission,
but the real and more important reason is supposed to
be connected with the affairs of the Netherlands. On
the last day of last month the King was invested with
the insignia of the Order in the Church of St. Augustine
during vespers, in the presence of the whole Chapter
of the Knights of the Holy Ghost; all the ambassadors
attended the ceremony by invitation; amongst them
were the envoys from the Netherlanders, but their
coming gave deep offence to the Spanish Ambassador.</p>

<p>To-morrow has been appointed for giving audience
to the aforesaid ambassadors, in company with the
English Ambassador, but, as to what the issue is likely
to be, people differ. There is no doubt that the King
is entering into the business without much heart, and
is even dissatisfied with certain terms in the proposed
arrangements, which do not go so far as he would like;
but the Queen Mother, whose hatred to anything
Spanish is unbounded, is exerting her influence in the
matter. People think that the King will give way to
his mother, and take up the cause of the Netherlands,
giving them secret support, even if he does not openly
adopt their quarrel. If so, war, I am afraid, will be the
consequence. The most important part in this adventure,
people say, will be assigned to Don Antonio<a name="FNanchor_225_225" id="FNanchor_225_225"></a><a href="#Footnote_225_225" class="fnanchor">225</a>; by
their account, he is to be given the command of the
French forces. In a business of this kind we can be
certain of the past, but of nothing else!</p>

<p>These are our troubles here; still, mischief is not
confined to Paris. A man tried to poison the King
of Navarre, but failed in the attempt, either by reason
of the strength of the King’s constitution, or the weakness
of the poison; the assassin then had recourse
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236">236</a></span>to open violence and levelled a pistol at the King.
He failed again, was arrested, and is being tried in
chains.<a name="FNanchor_226_226" id="FNanchor_226_226"></a><a href="#Footnote_226_226" class="fnanchor">226</a> The King is greatly distressed at the affair,
as indeed he has good reason to be, for his own
reputation is seriously affected. He has therefore
sent a distinguished judge to be present at the trial
and examination of the assassin under torture; he is
to bring back a true and accurate report as to whether
the fellow was suborned by some one, or acted from
motives of personal malice.</p>

has been compelled by famine to surrender to Parma,
and Antwerp is hard pressed, being debarred from all
use of the Scheldt by the completion of the bridge.
These tidings in all probability will rouse up the French
Court, and compel them to come to some decision with
regard to the Netherlanders, for, unless these last receive
some support, their defence must collapse. Indeed,
the ambassadors of the rebel States assume an
air of despondency, being disappointed at the King’s
handing over the responsibility to his mother, instead
of declaring war on his own account.</p>

<p class="noindent"><span class="smcap">The</span> English Ambassador left on the fourteenth of this
month, after a visit of twenty days, during which he
was treated with high honours, and received every
mark of respect. On leaving he was presented with
plate of the value of 4,000 crowns, and the chief gentlemen
in his train had also the honour of receiving
presents. A little later the Netherland ambassadors
took their leave, when each of them was presented
with a gold chain of the value of 200 crowns; their
visit has produced little or no result; at any rate, if any
arrangement has been made, it is a complete secret.
The King’s public answer was that he did not intend
to break the peace which subsisted between himself
and the King of Spain; the Queen Mother said,
she was deeply concerned for their preservation,
but was prevented by the King’s wishes from
giving them assistance. Whether any secret understanding
is implied in these ambiguous phrases, I
cannot say. The ambassadors have done their utmost
to draw the King into open war; this appears also to
have been the object of the English Ambassador, but
he does not seem to have had much success. Some
people think the King has undertaken to give them
considerable succours as soon as his present troubles
shall have blown over, and meanwhile to furnish
them with some little assistance. As regards the
troubles of which the King spoke, fresh storms are
without doubt brewing in his kingdom. The Guises
are levying war; the popular account is that they are
angry<a name="FNanchor_228_228" id="FNanchor_228_228"></a><a href="#Footnote_228_228" class="fnanchor">228</a> with the King for not recognising their own
<span class="pagenum2"><a name="Page_238" id="Page_238">238</a></span>and their family’s services, while a couple of young
fellows, distinguished for nothing save impudence and
conceit, are loaded with high offices and honours. But
this is not all; they wish to have a Catholic successor
appointed in case of the King’s death, and they are again
putting forward the Holy League and Confederacy
against heretics, in which they claim the leadership.
The meaning of all this is, that knowing there will be
no room for them in France, should Navarre, on the
death of the King, ascend the throne, they wish
betimes to grapple with this danger, and thus consult
their own interests, regardless of the great troubles
they must bring on the country. And, to be fair, there
is everywhere in France a feeling of great anxiety, as
people cannot tell what the position of the Church
will be after the King’s death. Many believe that their
ancient ritual, services, and sacraments will be profaned
and put down by Navarre, and that the Catholics will
be in the same position as the Protestants have hitherto
been, if indeed they be not in a worse case. These
fears give an excellent handle to those who are desirous
of a revolution, and men who have been true to
the old religion are in a peculiarly good position to
take advantage of it. Among these stand the Guises,
who are most popular in France, so much so that one
may hear them spoken of with greater deference than
the King himself. The family of Guise, they say, can
trace its descent in an unbroken line from Charlemagne,<a name="FNanchor_229_229" id="FNanchor_229_229"></a><a href="#Footnote_229_229" class="fnanchor">229</a>
has ever been the bulwark of the Church, ever
loyal to King and country, in spite of the neglect with
which it has been treated, and the bestowal on others
of the honours it has earned, and now is justified in
<span class="pagenum2"><a name="Page_239" id="Page_239">239</a></span>unsheathing the sword, exercising the Royal prerogatives,
and undertaking the defence of the Church.<a name="FNanchor_230_230" id="FNanchor_230_230"></a><a href="#Footnote_230_230" class="fnanchor">230</a></p>

<p>The Cardinal de Bourbon also has deserted his
family and takes part with the Guises. The King
has warned them by letters and messengers to have a
care of whither the road leads on which they are travelling;
to which they replied, they had no designs
against him, they had never swerved from the paths
of loyalty and duty, so that he ought not to believe
the calumnies of their enemies.</p>

<p>In spite of these protestations, reports are gaining
ground of German reiters being brought to France;
they say they are already on the borders of Lorraine, and
Guise will shortly have some 20,000 men under arms.</p>

<p>If one inquires whence the money will be forthcoming
for the campaign, everybody has an answer
ready to the effect that, with the Pope and the King
of Spain<a name="FNanchor_231_231" id="FNanchor_231_231"></a><a href="#Footnote_231_231" class="fnanchor">231</a> at their back, funds cannot be lacking, and
that there is an understanding between them and the
Guises is a matter beyond all doubt. Indeed, if one
considers who is to profit by these disturbances, it is
difficult to fix on any save the Pope and the King of
Spain; for the pacification of the latter’s provinces in
the Low Countries, and the successful accomplishment
of his plans are impossible so long as France is quiet
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_240" id="Page_240">240</a></span>and united. The King of Navarre is quite alive to
what is going on, and completely on his guard; indeed
he also is making ready to defend himself against any
murderous attack; he likewise offered the King his
services against the enemy. The King tells him not
to be uneasy; he is to make no movement, but
simply to keep his towns in readiness to repel any
sudden assault, and leave the rest to him.</p>

<p>I cannot say how far Navarre believes the King,
for some are disposed to suspect him of knowing
and approving of all the plans of the Guises; others
again hold that, while hitherto he has not been
privy to their schemes, he will in no long time adopt
their ideas and join their party; not that he loves
them, but because he hates Navarre still more, on
account of their old quarrels and the difference of their
religious views. For my own part, I have no doubt
that the King would sooner have anyone than Navarre
as successor to his throne, since he can have no
confidence that after his accession his policy will not
be reversed, the position of his connections and relations
be impaired, and his friends cast down from their
high estate; lastly, it is most annoying to feel that
after one’s death people will be exalted, whom during
one’s life one has desired to keep down. However, it
is not easy to trace the workings of the heart, and so
it is better to suspend our judgment till time makes all
things clear.</p>

<p>Not long ago the rumour was very general that a
fresh attempt against the life of the Queen of England
had been discovered.</p>

<p>The Hollanders and Zealanders are busy preparing
a fleet, which is to break through the bridge and
relieve Antwerp; should this attempt fail, they intend
opening the dykes between Antwerp and Bergen, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_241" id="Page_241">241</a></span>
flooding the country as far as Antwerp, so as to bring
their fleet, in spite of the bridge, up to the walls of the
town; this plan, however, must cause great suffering
throughout the neighbourhood, and proves how obstinate
they are; their own account is that they have no
other course.</p>

<p>March 26, 1585.</p></blockquote>

<hr />
<h3><a name="xlix" id="xlix">LETTER XLIX.</a></h3>

<p class="noindent"><span class="smcap">People</span> are becoming seriously alarmed. Suddenly
and unexpectedly France finds herself on the brink of
a great war; the King himself hardly knew of its
approach before it burst upon him. Two months
ago the Duke of Bouillon<a name="FNanchor_232_232" id="FNanchor_232_232"></a><a href="#Footnote_232_232" class="fnanchor">232</a> wrote cautioning him to be
on his guard, as the Guises were preparing for a
campaign. People say he is for ever deploring his
imprudence in disregarding this warning.</p>

<p>Nominally the chief mover in these disturbances is
the Cardinal de Bourbon, but, if I am not very much
mistaken, the real leaders are the three brothers—the
Dukes of Guise and Mayenne, and the Cardinal de
Lorraine, with their cousins the Duke of Aumale and
the Marquis of Elbœuf; they have also on their side
the Queen’s brother, the Duke of Mercœur, Governor
of Brittany; there are besides in the ranks of the insurrection
many gentlemen of less mark, with whose
names I need not trouble your Majesty.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_242" id="Page_242">242</a></span></p>
<p>The reasons of offence are numerous, but the chief
one is jealousy. For a long time the Guises have felt
bitterly their position at the Court, where they do not
hold the influence and station to which they consider
themselves entitled.<a name="FNanchor_233_233" id="FNanchor_233_233"></a><a href="#Footnote_233_233" class="fnanchor">233</a> Others are loaded with wealth
and honours, while they are held of no account, and
are left crippled by the debts, which they and their ancestors
have saddled themselves with in the service of
the State. The King, they complain, has picked out a
couple of young fellows on whom he lavishes his affection
and caresses, treating them like sons, squandering
on them the public revenues, living with them in the
closest intimacy, while the Guises are not merely kept
at a distance, but are actually insulted by having the
doors shut in their faces when they seek to enter into
the royal presence.</p>

<p>Besides these causes for complaint, there is a
notion, I fancy, which is not altogether groundless,
that the sister of Navarre, the heir of his kingdom and
extensive possessions, will marry the Duke of Epernon,
who is generally supposed to have been appointed by
the King Constable of France, and that the King,
who is not at present favourably disposed towards Navarre,
will be reconciled by this alliance, and support
his claims to the succession. In all probability the
object of the Guises is to put a stop to this arrangement,
which would be most disastrous to their interests,
as it is quite clear that, with Navarre or Condé
on the throne, their influence in France would be
obliterated.</p>

<p>The Cardinal de Bourbon<a name="FNanchor_234_234" id="FNanchor_234_234"></a><a href="#Footnote_234_234" class="fnanchor">234</a> assumes the title of successor
to the throne, and is indignant at the preference
given to the claims of his nephew; he has thrown off
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_243" id="Page_243">243</a></span>his Cardinal’s robes and fancies himself so much in a
soldier’s coat, that people think he must be childish.
He is fully convinced that he owes it to the Apostolic
See, to the faith he professes, to his family, and to
himself, not to allow a Protestant to ascend the throne
on the death of the King. He therefore considers
himself the Chief of the League, and demands the first
place in it. The Church, the Commonwealth, the convening<a name="FNanchor_235_235" id="FNanchor_235_235"></a><a href="#Footnote_235_235" class="fnanchor">235</a>
of the Estates, the security of the country, the
safety of honest people, the common pleas of all revolutionists,
are pressed into their service as a cloak for
their designs.</p>

<p>Again, there was a report of a Bull<a name="FNanchor_236_236" id="FNanchor_236_236"></a><a href="#Footnote_236_236" class="fnanchor">236</a> coming from
the Pope, which might arrive at any moment, pronouncing
Navarre and Condé incapable of ascending
the throne, as unfit and unworthy. For my own part,
I question the policy of such a step, showing as it
does the disunion of Christendom at a time when the
Turkish victories over the Persians render an invasion
more probable than ever; for there is no doubt that
the ultimate object of the Turks, in prosecuting their
long struggle with the Persians, is to prepare the way
for the extinction of Christianity. As soon as they have
secured their rear, by destroying or crippling their
Asiatic foe, they intend to concentrate their forces for
a struggle with us; they will fight with us for exist<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_244" id="Page_244">244</a></span>ence
and empire, and the chances are greatly in their
favour.<a name="FNanchor_237_237" id="FNanchor_237_237"></a><a href="#Footnote_237_237" class="fnanchor">237</a></p>

<p>But yet the movement I have described is so popular
that I cannot tell what the result will be. To the
King, indeed, this outbreak is a most untoward and
unexpected event, as he has neither forces nor funds
wherewith to meet the emergency. There is hardly a
Catholic nobleman in France who is not suspected of
being concerned in the designs of the Guises, and
secretly favouring the movement; almost all the provinces
are wavering in their allegiance; of the great
cities some are disloyal, while others refuse to receive
garrisons from the King. Thus he hardly knows
which way to turn, surrounded as he is with open
enemies, while his friends are few and weak. Whatever
efforts he may make to muster his troops, it will
be too late, for he has to deal with an enemy near at
hand and well prepared.</p>

<p>The only man I am surprised at is the Duke of
Mercœur;<a name="FNanchor_238_238" id="FNanchor_238_238"></a><a href="#Footnote_238_238" class="fnanchor">238</a> I cannot understand his taking up arms
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_245" id="Page_245">245</a></span>against the King, when he is brother to the Queen,
and has lately received great promotion from the King.
He has, however, had some provocation, inasmuch as
he has been deprived of certain privileges which his
predecessors in the government of Brittany enjoyed,
these having been transferred to the Duke of Joyeuse
as Admiral of France.<a name="FNanchor_239_239" id="FNanchor_239_239"></a><a href="#Footnote_239_239" class="fnanchor">239</a></p>

<p>Orleans, the most important town after Paris, has
declared for the Guises. Caen, on the coast of Normandy,
which is commanded by the strong fortifications
of its citadel, is in the hands of the Marquis of
Elbœuf; the citadel is held by d’O, who was formerly
one of the King’s mignons, but has now attached himself
to the party of the Guises. The Duke of Aumale has
seized several other places, and the Duke of Joyeuse
is on the march to recover them. The younger
Lansac, who is also a Guisite, has garrisoned Blaye,
near Bordeaux, and will prove a thorn in the side of
that town if it remains loyal to the King.<a name="FNanchor_240_240" id="FNanchor_240_240"></a><a href="#Footnote_240_240" class="fnanchor">240</a> De Brissac<a name="FNanchor_241_241" id="FNanchor_241_241"></a><a href="#Footnote_241_241" class="fnanchor">241</a>
holds the citadel of Angers. And thus, through the
length and breadth of the country, numbers are revolting
and bidding defiance to the King. An attempt
has also been made to seize Marseilles, but it proved
unsuccessful. These changes in the aspect of affairs
have made the Duke of Epernon a little more courteous;
he used to be so supercilious that when members
of the royal family spoke to him and removed
their hats, he kept his on his head; but now he has
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_246" id="Page_246">246</a></span>the grace to put his hand to his hat. This has given
rise to a popular joke, that Epernon has at last found
out where his hat is!</p>

<p>The King has sent deputies all round the country
to calm the storm, but they do not bring back any
offers of a compromise.</p>

<p>The Queen Mother is still staying with Guise, and
is oftentimes obliged to hear him speak of her son in
terms of bitter complaint. The Cardinal de Bourbon
is also with the Duke of Guise. Previous to his arrival
the latter used to protest against any application being
made to himself with reference to the rising, declaring
that he was not in command, but simply a private
gentleman fighting for the Holy League. The Archbishop
of Lyons is<a name="FNanchor_242_242" id="FNanchor_242_242"></a><a href="#Footnote_242_242" class="fnanchor">242</a> also there, as the King’s representative,
with very extensive powers. Unless they come
to terms the prospect for France is desperate, and we
are therefore anxiously awaiting the Queen’s<a name="FNanchor_243_243" id="FNanchor_243_243"></a><a href="#Footnote_243_243" class="fnanchor">243</a> return,
which will either mark the happy conclusion of a peace
with the party of the Guises or furnish the date for the
commencement of a disastrous war. According to
some, one of the terms of peace will be the restoration
of Cambrai to the King (Philip), which shows how
little the Guises care to hide the fact that in taking up
arms they are acting in concert with Spain.</p>

<p>The Queen of England, who sees the serious effect
of this movement to herself, is, they say, offering the
King 6,000 horse, to be hired at her expense, and to
consist of Englishmen or Switzers, as the King shall
decide. The King of Navarre also offers a strong
force of his partisans, fearing, as he well may, that he
is the real object of attack.</p>

<p>Without doubt your Imperial Majesty will have
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_247" id="Page_247">247</a></span>heard that the Marquis of Richebourg and sundry
others were killed at the Antwerp bridge;<a name="FNanchor_244_244" id="FNanchor_244_244"></a><a href="#Footnote_244_244" class="fnanchor">244</a> they say
that the Seigneur de Billy is also amongst the slain.</p>

<p>I am afraid I shall not be able to send despatches as
freely as before, since the roads to Metz and Nancy
are occupied by the soldiers of the two contending
parties, who examine and tear to pieces all communications;
indeed, I have my doubts as to whether this
very letter will be able to get through safely.</p>

<p class="noindent"><span class="smcap">The</span> war is thickening apace, yet nothing has happened
deserving special mention. The clergy are said to be
furnishing the King with 100,000 crowns a month, on
condition of his shortening the term within which, according
to his previous decree, the Huguenots must
leave the country. He has acceded to this demand,
as your Majesty will see by reading the enclosed pro<span class="pagenum2"><a name="Page_248" id="Page_248">248</a></span>clamation;<a name="FNanchor_247_247" id="FNanchor_247_247"></a><a href="#Footnote_247_247" class="fnanchor">247</a>
but even this has failed to convince the
people that the King really and honestly shares the
views of the League, and has joined the party; for,
according to some, it is only a device to extract money,
and when he has gained his object he will turn his
coat! Time will show.</p>

<p>A small party of Huguenot soldiers, not twenty in
number, created a panic by seizing the citadel of Angers;<a name="FNanchor_248_248" id="FNanchor_248_248"></a><a href="#Footnote_248_248" class="fnanchor">248</a>
the excitement was increased by the news that
the Prince of Condé was coming; he had crossed the
Loire, they said, and quartered his soldiers in the
suburbs. All the troops that could be got together
were hurried off to Angers, as well as the Swiss guard,
and thither went all the leaders, Joyeuse, Epernon,
Mayenne, and Biron.</p>

<p>But Condé, finding himself surrounded by such
powerful forces, and seeing that he would not be able to
reach the citadel, abandoned his design and retired
across the Loire; he then broke up his army, and
sought safety in the country occupied by his own garrisons.
Meanwhile it was the common talk, and generally
believed, that he had been taken prisoner while
crossing some river or other, but it soon became
clear that the story had no foundation. Shortly
after this affair the King recalled his forces, which
have suffered severely from the incessant rains and the
hardships of an autumn campaign; neither have they
altogether escaped the epidemic which is now raging.</p>

<p>The inhabitants of Auxonne, a town in Burgundy,
have accused their commander<a name="FNanchor_249_249" id="FNanchor_249_249"></a><a href="#Footnote_249_249" class="fnanchor">249</a> of high treason,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_249" id="Page_249">249</a></span>charging him with intending to admit a Spanish garrison
into the citadel, and under cover of this assertion
they are pulling down a large part of the fortifications.</p>

<p>The men of Lyons levelled their citadel to the
ground some time ago, and people say the King has
given orders that the citadel of Angers shall be treated
in the same way. So there is a great dismantling of
fortifications in France, while in other parts new ones
are being built.</p>

<p>I shall enclose the Papal Bull<a name="FNanchor_250_250" id="FNanchor_250_250"></a><a href="#Footnote_250_250" class="fnanchor">250</a> declaring Navarre
and Condé incapable of succeeding to the throne of
France. What effect it will have God only knows;
for my own part, I am afraid it will be the signal for
greater disturbances. Still the King, they say, <em>has</em>
confiscated all the property of Navarre on which he
could lay his hands, and placed it in the custody of the
Cardinal de Vendôme,<a name="FNanchor_251_251" id="FNanchor_251_251"></a><a href="#Footnote_251_251" class="fnanchor">251</a> the owner’s cousin.</p>

<p>The Bishop of Paris has gone to Rome, as the
King’s Ambassador, to treat for the appropriation of
ecclesiastical property to the service of the State, and,
no doubt, concerning other matters as well.</p>

<p>Again, a new Ambassador<a name="FNanchor_252_252" id="FNanchor_252_252"></a><a href="#Footnote_252_252" class="fnanchor">252</a> of high rank is on his
way to Constantinople; his policy, I imagine, will be
anything but favourable to the peace of Germany.
There is nothing they are so much afraid of here as
German reiters, and they have apparently come to the
conclusion that the best way of keeping them employed
elsewhere is to threaten their country with a Turkish
war.</p>

<p>I understand that one packet of the despatches I
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_250" id="Page_250">250</a></span>wrote in May is missing. I cannot tell where it was
stopped. I sent it by way of Brussels as the safest
route. My present letter will also go by the same
road, but I shall take further precautions to ensure its
safety. I trust that the missing packet will also eventually
reach your Majesty.</p>

<p class="noindent"><span class="smcap">Although</span> nothing worth recording has happened
since I last wrote, nevertheless I take up my pen because
I have a chance of sending a letter, which does
not often occur now-a-days.</p>

<p>The Duke of Mayenne’s forces are now in close
contact with the enemy, and we shall soon see in what
direction he is moving, and his prospects of success in
the campaign.</p>

<p>The King has made up his mind not to allow
a single Huguenot, or indeed anyone who is not a
Catholic, to remain in France; consequently all who
do not care to change their religion are leaving the
country. A few days ago a petition was presented
to the King on behalf of certain women and girls,
imploring leave to remain in France under his protection,
and promising that they would live in retirement
and give offence to no one. The King would
not grant their request, but took care that they should
not be injured, and sent them to England under his
safe conduct.</p>

<p>As to the rest, the King is wrapt up in his new
religious services, and lives like a hermit. People are
afraid his health will be affected by the austerities he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_251" id="Page_251">251</a></span>
practises, or that he will become the victim of some
superstitious craze.</p>

<p>The Queen of England is openly taking Holland
and Zealand, with certain towns besides, under her
protection, and has issued a proclamation to that effect.
I cannot say whether she will give much help to places
at a distance from the sea, but the maritime position
of England renders it probable that the towns on the
coast will derive great assistance from her powerful
navy.</p>

<p>So, at any rate, the war will be prolonged, with all
its sufferings and all its uncertainties, while the blockade
by sea will bring the other provinces of the Netherlands
into danger of starvation.</p>

<p class="noindent"><span class="smcap">Navarre</span>, having shaken off the enemy, determined to
assault the faubourgs of Paris. I lately hinted at the
probability of such a movement. Marching with all
his forces on the capital, he stormed and sacked the
four faubourgs of the Université,<a name="FNanchor_253_253" id="FNanchor_253_253"></a><a href="#Footnote_253_253" class="fnanchor">253</a> each of which is as
<span class="pagenum2"><a name="Page_252" id="Page_252">252</a></span>big as a good-sized town. The garrison, which consisted
of citizens, was severely handled, as Navarre’s
men contrived to slip in between them and the city
walls, and thus cut off their retreat. Many of them
were taken prisoners, and more of them killed, no
quarter being given except to those who could convince
their captors that they had the amount of their ransom
in hard cash in their houses. The number slain and
captured is believed to be at least 2,000. The day
after this defeat Mayenne entered the city. Navarre,
after halting for a time and offering battle,
retreated a few miles from Paris with his booty and
prisoners. He next retook Etampes, which the enemy
had occupied; although it is an open town, the position
is important from its commanding the road to Paris
from the principal corn-growing districts. Mayenne,
they say, can still muster a considerable force, but, as
he has not the means of paying his troops, his presence
is more a burden to the Parisians than an advantage.
Whatever the enemy has either not found out or not
thought worth taking, becomes their booty. Thus the
Parisians suffer equally from friend and from foe. No
wonder provisions get scarce, and Paris begins to feel
the effects of war in all their bitterness. Perhaps winter
and the difficulty of finding money will bring the
first act of this tragedy to a close, and then each party
will endeavour to support their cause by convening
the Estates of the Kingdom. The Lorraine party, the
<span class="pagenum2"><a name="Page_253" id="Page_253">253</a></span>towns, and the Order of the Clergy will meet at Paris;
Navarre and the leading nobles at Tours. He will
there, probably, do all he can to have some kind of
Coronation service performed, in order to increase his
authority, and justify his assumption of the title of
‘Royal Majesty.’ He will not however remain quite
idle in the meantime, but will carry on operations in
Berry, the Orleanais, Brittany, and elsewhere, as opportunities
may occur. At Tours he will be able, should
it prove desirable, to treat with the young Duke of
Guise, the Cardinal de Bourbon, and the other prisoners,<a name="FNanchor_254_254" id="FNanchor_254_254"></a><a href="#Footnote_254_254" class="fnanchor">254</a>
with a view to a general pacification. Many are sure
that negotiations will be opened, and that steps have
already been taken in this direction with some prospects
of success. I remain your Imperial Majesty’s
most humble servant.</p>

<span class="pagenum2"><a name="Page_255" id="Page_255">255</a></span>divine service according to the Catholic rite. Others
deny this; but admit that, in the speech which he made
on the occasion, he declared that as regarded religion he
would soon give them such satisfaction that no one
would have any just ground for complaint left. They
say that he has appointed Montmorency Constable of
France; he is expected to come to Tours and do
homage to the King on his Coronation. There is no
longer any doubt of the capture of the town of Le
Mans, nor does the mischief stop there, for some
assert, that Chartres, a wealthy and fortified city, has
gone over to Navarre. He has for some time been
master of the territory of Bourges, and negotiations
are now in progress, they say, for the surrender of the
town itself. There is the same news about Melun,
which lies on the Seine above Paris; the position is
important for preventing the introduction of provisions
into the capital. Further, some would have it believed
that the governor of the port of Havre de Grâce in
Normandy is ready to come to terms with Navarre.
If even a part, and much more if all, of these rumours
be true, it is serious news for the Parisians. They are
now busy counting the Spanish money, which, they
say, amounts to 300,000 crowns. Still, I cannot see
that they have any trustworthy resources to support
their resistance, and I am consequently afraid that,
when Navarre returns, Paris will fall. According to
some he is to be expected shortly, others say not till
spring. I have great fears for the town where I am
now staying, and am therefore obliged to look out for
a new hiding place, as I would fain avoid the horrors
which occur when a city is taken by storm. The
Marquis of Pont-à-Musson<a name="FNanchor_258_258" id="FNanchor_258_258"></a><a href="#Footnote_258_258" class="fnanchor">258</a> has crossed into Flanders,
<span class="pagenum2"><a name="Page_256" id="Page_256">256</a></span>intending to return from there either through Brabant
or through Hainault and Namur. The Council at

said to have been dissolved, and the supreme authority
again restored to the Parliament, which issues decrees
in the name of Charles X. i.e. the Cardinal de Bourbon.
It is to be feared, however, that the Parliament, which
was removed to Tours by the late King Henry, is the
stronger of the two. The Duke of Parma is said to
be suffering from illness. I do not know the exact
nature of his complaint, but it is certainly a dangerous
one. The troubles of the times will greatly hinder the
Queen of France (Elizabeth of Austria, the widow of
Charles IX.) from receiving and enjoying her property
and rents in this kingdom as usual. At the utmost
they will be barely sufficient for half the necessary
expenses of the maintenance of herself and her household.
I have already ventured, I think, to call your
Majesty’s attention to the Queen’s position in this
respect, and now that this curtailment of her income is
at hand I have judged it to be my duty to repeat the
warning. I trust your Majesty will consider how the
Queen is to be provided for, until this storm has
passed by.</p>

<p class="noindent"><span class="smcap">A meeting</span> of the States-General of the kingdom has
been summoned at Tours by Navarre to consider the
state of the country, and to take measures for punishing

has been long expected at Paris, stopped at Dijon on
the way. Thither he summoned the people of Langres,
and invited them to abandon Navarre and acknowledge
Charles X. (the Cardinal de Bourbon) as King.
On their refusal, he laid them under an Interdict, and
transferred their bishopric to Dijon.<a name="FNanchor_261_261" id="FNanchor_261_261"></a><a href="#Footnote_261_261" class="fnanchor">261</a> People think he

against Spain.<a name="FNanchor_262_262" id="FNanchor_262_262"></a><a href="#Footnote_262_262" class="fnanchor">262</a> People are anxiously waiting to see
at what point Navarre will make his next attack. He
has taken several important cities in Normandy. Some
think he intends to besiege Rouen,<a name="FNanchor_263_263" id="FNanchor_263_263"></a><a href="#Footnote_263_263" class="fnanchor">263</a> which is already
exhausted by the calamities of war. Things, how<span class="pagenum2"><a name="Page_258" id="Page_258">258</a></span>ever,
are not yet ripe for this, nor has he troops
enough for such an undertaking, but for us forces are
being raised, and will soon be ready. The result of
Mayenne’s enterprises remains to be seen. His plan
seems to have been to demolish all the forts of the
enemy on the Seine, and so free the navigation of the
river from Rouen up to Paris. This he will not find
an easy task, especially with Navarre so near at hand.
In proof of this the fort of Meulan,<a name="FNanchor_264_264" id="FNanchor_264_264"></a><a href="#Footnote_264_264" class="fnanchor">264</a> before which, as I
mentioned, he sat down, shows no signs of alarm, and
does not seem likely to yield easily to his attacks.
The reputation of both generals is at stake; the question
being, whether Mayenne shall abandon his enterprise,
or Navarre allow his friends to be destroyed
before his eyes, or either commander refuse to engage
when offered battle by the other.</p>

<p>I hear, to my great astonishment, that the King of
Scotland has married the eldest daughter of the King
of Denmark, as I thought Navarre’s sister was intended
for him. In the Netherlands the Duke of
Parma, they say, has taken offence at something or
other, and has therefore withdrawn himself from almost
all the duties of his position, and avoiding the crowded
Court has for some time past allowed himself to nurse
his vexation, and that Councillor Richardot has on
that account been sent to the King of Spain.</p>

<p>To the other cities that Navarre has taken in a
short time, they think Evreux will soon be added.
Though it is not a strongly fortified town, it is the
seat of a bishopric and a county. It is ten miles
from here. He has already occupied the suburbs.
Both this town and the whole neighbourhood were
greatly terrified at the news, fearing a similar fate,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_259" id="Page_259">259</a></span>but he seems to intend to direct his march against
Rouen, for he sent a trumpeter thither to summon
them to surrender, and to threaten them with
destruction, if they refused. At the crash of so many
towns falling all around it, Rouen appears to be horror-struck,
and therefore to desire peace at any price. On
this Navarre builds his hopes. Meanwhile the siege
of the fort of Meulan, of which I spoke, goes on very
languidly.<a name="FNanchor_265_265" id="FNanchor_265_265"></a><a href="#Footnote_265_265" class="fnanchor">265</a></p>

<h3>LETTER LVIII.</h3>

<p class="noindent"><span class="smcap">Mayenne</span> has arrived at Meaux with his army. He
is, however, too weak to raise the siege of Paris, or
to engage the King with a fair prospect of success.
When offered battle he declined it, and withdrew to a
safe position. The King thought this an additional
reason for pressing the siege. Though he had effected
a lodgment in the suburbs, yet the parts of
them which were nearest the city were more in the
citizens’ power than his own. He therefore resolved
to push forward his entrenchments to the walls of the
city. This operation was executed in a single night,
the breastwork of the besiegers being carried up to
the very gates. Thenceforth no one was able to
enter or leave Paris without his permission. Meanwhile
the famine was growing so sore, that it seemed
impossible for them to hold out much longer, and
more than 12,000 perished of hunger. The inhabitants,
<span class="pagenum2"><a name="Page_260" id="Page_260">260</a></span>however, bore their sufferings patiently, and preferred
to hold out to the bitter end rather than abandon the
cause for which they were fighting. They were sustained
in this resolve by the promises of the Spanish
Ambassador and the Papal Legate, who declared that
the Duke of Parma himself was on the point of
coming with a mighty army to their relief, an assertion
which was soon afterwards verified. Parma arrived
at last, after negotiations for peace had actually
been opened. On the 6th of this month the Cardinal
de Gondi and the Archbishop of Lyons, the Primate
of Gaul,<a name="FNanchor_266_266" id="FNanchor_266_266"></a><a href="#Footnote_266_266" class="fnanchor">266</a> went under a safe-conduct to the King.
They failed to come to terms, but the negotiations
were adjourned, in the hope that a further interchange
of views might lead to peace. Finally, it was agreed
that three commissioners on each side should meet at
the fortress of Nanteuil<a name="FNanchor_267_267" id="FNanchor_267_267"></a><a href="#Footnote_267_267" class="fnanchor">267</a> and the mansion of Schom<span class="pagenum2"><a name="Page_261" id="Page_261">261</a></span>berg,
nine French miles from Paris.<a name="FNanchor_268_268" id="FNanchor_268_268"></a><a href="#Footnote_268_268" class="fnanchor">268</a> The prospects
of peace thus appeared to be improving, when letters
of Mayenne to his mother and wife were intercepted,
in which he exhorted them to hold out a little longer,
and told them that he was actually on the march to
their relief; there was no fear, he added, that <em>he</em> would
demean himself by acknowledging a heretic as his
King, or by coming to terms with him. The King
showed these letters to the Cardinal and Archbishop,
and was on the point of breaking off negotiations, but
at their entreaty he finally consented to await the day
which had been fixed for the termination of the armistice,
namely, the 26th of this month. He did not
sacrifice much by this concession, as he had already
decided to wait for a picked body of horse and foot,
under Nevers and the Vicomte de Turenne, whom he
expected in a few days. He only withdrew his cannon
from the gates of Paris, and deposited them in St.
Denis with his other heavy baggage, that he might
have his hands free, if he were obliged to fight or
should be summoned elsewhere, it being his usual
practice to leave his baggage behind, when he undertakes
any operation. Apart from this he made no
change, and did not move a single soldier from his
position under the ramparts of Paris.</p>

<p>In case of an engagement taking place, the news
will in all probability reach your Majesty before my
account of it arrives. Therefore, in order that your
Majesty may be in a better position to estimate the
value of such reports, I feel it my duty to submit for
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_262" id="Page_262">262</a></span>your consideration a sketch of both generals, the
King and Mayenne, and their several forces. The
contest will be one between two famous leaders,
in the prime of life and at the height of their renown,
one of whom, Mayenne, will give up the command to
Parma, and will fight as his subordinate. The King
is a thorough soldier, and a general of the greatest
experience. When all his forces are concentrated, he
will have, it is thought, some 20,000 infantry and 6,000
cavalry. The latter for the most part is composed of gentlemen,
well armed and splendidly mounted. Of French
infantry people think he will have 13,000, and of Swiss,
with whom are a few Germans, 7,000. The <em lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">élite</em> of
his foot consists of a body of four or five thousand
Gascon veterans. All his troops, horse and foot alike,
are devoted to their King, by whom they are accustomed
to be led, and whose presence inspires them with
confidence. Moreover, the King has with him veteran
generals of great experience, whose advice and
assistance are invaluable; namely, Biron, d’Aumont,
La Noue, and many others. Round him too have
gathered the Princes of the Bourbon blood, with the
leading gentlemen from every part of France.</p>

<p>With regard to Parma and Mayenne, in point of
generalship there is not much to choose between them,
but it must be admitted that the latter is a most unlucky
commander, while the former is a favourite of
fortune, as is proved by his long list of successes in
the Netherlands, and in this respect he may fairly be
considered a match for the King. Their united infantry,
as report goes, amounts to 17,000, while their
cavalry is a little under 5,000 strong. Among their
foot the Spaniards and Walloons are considered the
best, and these, with the addition of some Italian companies,
are not much over 4,000 strong. Next to these<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_263" id="Page_263">263</a></span>
come the Germans; the French and Lorrainers are
the worst.</p>

<p>The King and Parma are now wholly engaged in
concocting devices against each other, the object being
to inflict the maximum of damage with the minimum
of loss to their own troops. To enable his men to
resist the charge of the French cavalry, Parma encloses
his infantry with a fence formed of ropes of the
strongest and thickest description, which are supported
by stout stakes at regular intervals. Immediately behind
the ropes he posts his musketeers, who can thus
fire on the French horse in perfect security. All the
musketeers have a store of double bullets fastened
together with copper wire, which will be very effective
against horses. The cannon also are loaded with
chain-shot, and masked batteries are planted in good
positions, with troops drawn up in front so as to conceal
them from the enemy; at the critical moment
they will open fire, and pour a withering volley among
the horses of their assailants.</p>

<p>Meanwhile the King is not idle. Every day he
takes counsel with his craftiest and wisest captains,
to see if they cannot devise a new mode of attack.
Some weapon is to be invented or some wonderful
manœuvre to be executed, which is to discomfit the
enemy.</p>

<p>On each side, therefore, is a distinguished general
and a powerful army. The King’s forces are supposed
to be somewhat larger than Parma’s, and he has also
a decided superiority in the composition of his troops,
for, with a few exceptions, they are all men of the same
nation and his own subjects, whereas Parma’s forces have
been recruited from various nations, and are to a large
extent made up of raw levies, on whom not much reliance
can be placed. Again, the King has the great<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_264" id="Page_264">264</a></span>
advantage of fighting on his own ground, that is to
say, on ground which he has previously chosen and
fortified, while Parma, by the circumstances of his position,
is compelled to attack at a disadvantage.</p>

<p>Such are the premises; whether they are sufficient
for forming an opinion as to what the result of a
battle would be, is more than I can say. They are
valuable only in the same sense as the warnings of a
sunset are valuable in enabling us to guess what
weather we shall have to-morrow. Besides, it is mere
guessing, and no more; victory does not depend on
scythed chariots, or horses, or on the number of soldiers,
or the abundance of munitions, but solely on the
will of God.</p>

<p>If I have lingered longer over this subject than has
been agreeable, I trust I may be pardoned. That God
may long preserve your Majesty is the prayer of your
most humble servant.</p>

<i>SKETCH OF HUNGARIAN HISTORY DURING
THE REIGN OF SOLYMAN.</i></h3>

<p class="noindent"><span class="smcap">In</span> order that the reader may be able to appreciate the
circumstances under which Busbecq’s Turkish letters
were written, and to understand many of the allusions
they contain, it is necessary that he should have the
power of referring easily to the leading events of Hungarian
and Transylvanian history during the reign of Solyman.
For Busbecq’s French letters, Motley’s ‘Dutch
Republic’ and ‘United Netherlands’ may be consulted,
but no such works in English upon Hungarian
history exist. The narratives of Robertson and Creasy
are meagre in this respect, and contain only scattered
and incidental notices of Hungarian events; while Von
Hammer, and the Austrian and Turkish histories in
Heeren’s Series, valuable as they are, have not been
translated into English, and besides are not easily
accessible. None of these works give a connected
narrative of Hungarian affairs, the notices of which
are mixed up with the general Turkish and Austrian
history, and have to be picked out from it with much
time and trouble. It is hoped that this sketch will
to some extent supply the deficiency, and furnish a
clue to the intricate maze of Hungarian politics. Some
curious facts have been gleaned from Katona’s ‘Critical
History of Hungary,’ a rare book, which is mostly
composed of original documents, including numerous
letters written by Busbecq’s colleague, Verantius, after<span class="pagenum2"><a name="Page_268" id="Page_268">268</a></span>
he had returned from his embassy, and long extracts
from Busbecq’s own letters.</p>

<p>During the sixteenth century Hungary formed the
Debatable Land between Christendom and Islam.
The picture which the ‘Lay of the Last Minstrel’
and the ‘Monastery’ give of the condition of the
English and Scottish border, will suggest a faint
notion of the state of things all along the frontier between
the Turkish and the Christian dominions. Upon
both sides continual forays were made, villages were
plundered and burnt, castles surprised, cattle driven
off, and, worst of all, prisoners were carried away into
hopeless slavery.<a name="FNanchor_270_270" id="FNanchor_270_270"></a><a href="#Footnote_270_270" class="fnanchor">270</a> Every few years these desultory
hostilities broke out into open war, and, notwithstanding
occasional successes of Ferdinand’s party, the
tide of Turkish invasion rose steadily higher and
higher. In addition, the unfortunate country was distracted
by civil war, waged with varying success
between Ferdinand and the House of Zapolya, the
rivals for the throne, while the magnates of the kingdom
went over from one side to the other, according
as they thought they could thereby gain any advantage
for themselves.</p>

<p>Solyman, the greatest Sovereign of the House of
Othman, was born in 1494, and succeeded his father,
Selim I., in September 1520. The first year of his
reign was marked by a campaign against Hungary,
and the fall of Belgrade,<a name="FNanchor_271_271" id="FNanchor_271_271"></a><a href="#Footnote_271_271" class="fnanchor">271</a> the bulwark of that kingdom.
Louis, the King of Hungary and Bohemia, was
then a minor, and, in the party strife of the different
factions of the nobility, the defence of the country was
neglected. For several years Solyman’s attention was
diverted to other enterprises, of which the most famous
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_269" id="Page_269">269</a></span>was the siege and capture of Rhodes in 1522, but in
1526 he again invaded Hungary. On August 29,
the anniversary of the capture of Belgrade, he defeated
King Louis with great slaughter at Mohacz,<a name="FNanchor_272_272" id="FNanchor_272_272"></a><a href="#Footnote_272_272" class="fnanchor">272</a> the King
himself perishing in the flight, and then advanced on
Buda, which surrendered on September 10. Thence
he crossed to Pesth, where he received the Hungarian
nobles, and, after promising them to make John
Zapolya, Count of Zips and Voivode or Viceroy of
Transylvania, King of Hungary, returned laden with
booty to Constantinople.</p>

<p>Ferdinand, the brother of Charles V. and his successor
as Emperor, and Zapolya were rivals for the
crown of St. Stephen. The first relied upon family
compacts, and upon his connection by marriage with
King Louis.<a name="FNanchor_273_273" id="FNanchor_273_273"></a><a href="#Footnote_273_273" class="fnanchor">273</a> Zapolya, on the other hand, was supported
by a strong party among the nobles, who disliked
Ferdinand as a foreigner. Zapolya’s partisans
took the initiative, and convened a diet at Tokay, at
which he was elected King, and he was duly crowned
at Stuhlweissenburg by the Archbishop of Gran.
Mary, however, the widowed Queen, with the Palatine
Bathory, assembled another diet at Presburg, which
declared Zapolya’s election void on the ground that the
diet of Tokay had not been summoned by the Palatine,
and elected Ferdinand King, who, after defeating
his rival at Tokay in 1527, and near Kaschau in the
following year, drove him out of the country. Zapolya
then threw himself on Solyman’s protection, offering
to hold Hungary and Transylvania as his tributary,
and a treaty of alliance was signed between them in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_270" id="Page_270">270</a></span>
February 1528. In the following year Solyman invaded
Hungary for the third time, and took Buda on
September 9. A few days afterwards Zapolya was
again installed on the throne by the first lieutenant of
the Aga of the Janissaries, and did homage for his
kingdom. Leaving a Turkish governor in Buda, the
Sultan then marched on Vienna, and besieged it on
the 27th, but was obliged to abandon the siege on
October 16, in consequence of the lateness of the
season and the gallant resistance of the garrison and
inhabitants.<a name="FNanchor_274_274" id="FNanchor_274_274"></a><a href="#Footnote_274_274" class="fnanchor">274</a></p>

<p>In the winter of 1530 Ferdinand’s troops besieged
Buda unsuccessfully. In the campaign of 1532 Charles
V. came with the forces of the Empire to the assistance
of his brother, and Styria and Austria were the seat of
war. The Sultan was detained for three weeks before
the little town of Güns by the gallantry of the commander
Jurischitz, who at last surrendered on honourable
terms.<a name="FNanchor_275_275" id="FNanchor_275_275"></a><a href="#Footnote_275_275" class="fnanchor">275</a> The delay, however, prevented the Sultan
from accomplishing anything considerable, though his
army ravaged Styria and Austria, and penetrated as
far as Gratz and Linz.</p>

<p>In June 1533 peace was concluded between Ferdinand
and Solyman on the basis of Ferdinand’s retaining
what he actually held in Hungary, the Sultan
reserving to himself the ratification of any arrangements
that Ferdinand and Zapolya might make between
themselves.</p>

<p>For some years afterwards Solyman’s attention was
devoted to his wars with Persia, and no invasion of
Hungary on a large scale occurred; but, notwithstanding
the peace, the Pashas of Bosnia and the adjoining
districts continued their inroads. To check
these incursions Ferdinand, in 1537, assembled at
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_271" id="Page_271">271</a></span>Kaproncza, on the Drave, an army of 16,000 foot
and 8,000 horse, under the supreme command of
Katzianer. He advanced on Essek, intending to
besiege it, but was surrounded by clouds of light
cavalry, who cut off his supplies and forced him to
retreat. After losing his siege-guns at the passage of
the Vouka, he encountered the enemy on December 1,
and, after an unsuccessful engagement, fled in the night
with some of the other generals. The troops that
were left were cut to pieces the next day with their
gallant commander, Lodron.<a name="FNanchor_276_276" id="FNanchor_276_276"></a><a href="#Footnote_276_276" class="fnanchor">276</a> Katzianer was accused
of causing the disaster by his cowardice, and was
thrown into prison at Vienna. He escaped by bribing
his gaolers, and fled to one of his castles in Croatia,
where he entered into negotiations with the Turks,
promising to betray the strong fortress of Kosthanitza.
However, his treasonable designs were cut short;
Count Nicholas Zriny, during an interview with him
at one of his castles, treacherously stabbed him, and
despatched him with the assistance of his servants.
His body was flung from a window into the castle
ditch, and his head was sent to Vienna.</p>

<p>In 1538, under the mediation of Charles V., the
treaty of Gross Wardein was concluded between
Zapolya and Ferdinand. Zapolya was to retain the
title of King during his life with Transylvania and the
part of Hungary which was then in his actual possession,
on his death his male issue was to succeed
to Transylvania only, and by the same treaty both
parties united in a league for mutual defence against
the Turks.</p>

<p>Zapolya had then neither wife nor child; but he
immediately afterwards married Isabella, the King of
Poland’s daughter, and, dying in July 1540, left by her
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_272" id="Page_272">272</a></span>a son—John Sigismund—who was born a fortnight
before his father’s death.</p>

<p>Ferdinand then claimed that, according to the terms
of the treaty, he should be placed in possession of the
whole of Hungary; but Isabella, as guardian of her
infant son, and the party opposed to Ferdinand, under
the leadership of Martinuzzi, Bishop of Gross Wardein,
refused to adhere to the treaty, caused the infant to be
crowned, and appealed to the Sultan for protection.
Ferdinand then entered the country, and besieged Buda,
which was relieved by the Pasha of Belgrade.</p>

<p>Solyman again invaded Hungary in 1541. On
August 29 his troops occupied the gates of Buda, and
he annexed that city to his dominions, making it the
seat of a Pashalic, and placing a strong garrison in it.
He declared, however, that he held it merely in trust
for John Sigismund during his minority, and in the
meantime appointed the latter Sanjak-bey of Transylvania,
under the regency of Martinuzzi and Petrovich.
The House of Zapolya held, in addition to Transylvania,
most of the country to the north as far as the
river Theiss.</p>

<p>In 1543 Solyman again invaded Hungary, and took
the cities of Gran and Stuhlweissenburg, or Alba Regia,
the former being the primatial see of Hungary, and the
latter the burial-place of her Kings. At the end of
1544, Jerome Adorno, provost of Erlau, was sent by
Ferdinand as internuncio to Solyman, with John Maria
Malvezzi, a member of a noble family of Bologna, as
secretary; but he died shortly after his arrival at
Adrianople, in March 1545. Malvezzi, aided by
Nicholas Sicco, who was sent by Ferdinand as a new
ambassador, and Veltwick, the ambassador of Charles V.,
then undertook the management of the negotiations, and
concluded in November an armistice for eighteen months<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_273" id="Page_273">273</a></span>
between Solyman on the one side, and Ferdinand and
Charles on the other.<a name="FNanchor_277_277" id="FNanchor_277_277"></a><a href="#Footnote_277_277" class="fnanchor">277</a> This was followed, in June 1547,
by a peace for five years, in which the Emperor, the
Pope, France, and Venice were included, on the basis of
<em>uti possidetis</em>, Ferdinand paying the Sultan 30,000
ducats a year, part of which sum was an equivalent for
the territories of some of the nobles, who had formerly
adhered to the Turkish side, and had afterwards gone
over to Ferdinand, and part was termed by him a present,
but was more justly considered by the Turks as
tribute for the portion of Hungary which still remained
in his possession.</p>

<p>The Sultan’s motive for concluding this treaty was
his desire to turn his arms against Persia. Elkass
Mirza, a brother of Shah Tahmasp, the reigning
monarch, had taken refuge at his court in 1547,<a name="FNanchor_278_278" id="FNanchor_278_278"></a><a href="#Footnote_278_278" class="fnanchor">278</a> and in
1548 Solyman led his troops into Persia, and obtained
considerable successes. In the following year Elkass
was captured by his brother in an expedition he had
undertaken, and was confined in a fortress for the rest
of his life.</p>

<p>In July 1551, at Martinuzzi’s instigation, Isabella
ceded Transylvania and the part of Hungary that
remained in her hands to Ferdinand, in exchange for
the towns of Ratibor and Oppeln in Silesia, and the
Austrian troops, under the command of the Spaniard
Castaldo, took possession of these territories.<a name="FNanchor_279_279" id="FNanchor_279_279"></a><a href="#Footnote_279_279" class="fnanchor">279</a> When
Solyman heard this news, he summoned Malvezzi
before him, who pledged his life that there was no
ground for this report; but, as he could not give
satisfactory explanations, and fell back on the insufficiency
of his instructions, he was thrown into prison in
the Black Tower of the Castle of Anatolia on the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_274" id="Page_274">274</a></span>Bosphorus,<a name="FNanchor_280_280" id="FNanchor_280_280"></a><a href="#Footnote_280_280" class="fnanchor">280</a> the Sultan excusing this violation of international
law by the argument that an ambassador was
a hostage for the good faith of his master, and should
suffer for any breach of it. From this incident it appears
that the post of ambassador at the Porte was
by no means unattended with danger.</p>

<p>Ferdinand rewarded Martinuzzi by procuring for
him a Cardinal’s hat, and appointing him Archbishop
of Gran. Not content with these dignities, that wily
politician made overtures to the Turks, with the object
of gaining the sovereignty of Transylvania and
Hungary for himself; but he was assassinated by
Castaldo’s officers acting under Ferdinand’s orders, or,
at any rate, with his connivance, at Alvincz, December
18, 1551.</p>

<p>In 1552 the Turks recommenced their attacks on
Hungary, which were attended with almost uniform
success. In February they gained a victory at Szegedin;
in April, Wessprim was taken by Ali, the Pasha
of Buda; and in July Temeswar fell. Its capture
was followed by the loss of the rest of the Banat. On
August 11, Ali Pasha defeated an army of Ferdinand’s
at Fülek, to the north of Buda, Sforzia Pallavicini was
taken prisoner, and Sbardellatus Dudich, the Bishop
of Waitzen, whom Busbecq calls by mistake the Bishop
of Fünfkirchen, was killed.<a name="FNanchor_281_281" id="FNanchor_281_281"></a><a href="#Footnote_281_281" class="fnanchor">281</a> Erlau, however, was besieged
by Ali unsuccessfully.</p>

<p>In April 1552, Ferdinand wrote to Roostem, the
Grand Vizier, asking for Malvezzi’s release, and for a
safe conduct for two more envoys. In consequence,
Malvezzi was removed to the Seven Towers, and his
allowance was increased; but he was still kept in close
confinement.</p>

<p>Fortunately for Ferdinand at this critical junc<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_275" id="Page_275">275</a></span>ture,
a Persian invasion and the Sultan’s domestic
troubles created a diversion in his favour. In 1553
the Sultan, on account of the mutinous disposition of
the army, which had been sent to defend Armenia
against the Persians, was obliged to take command of
it in person. The most notable event of the campaign
was the tragical end of Mustapha, Solyman’s eldest
and most promising son. The story of his cruel murder
is narrated in pathetic words by our author in his
first letter,<a name="FNanchor_282_282" id="FNanchor_282_282"></a><a href="#Footnote_282_282" class="fnanchor">282</a> though he is mistaken in placing the scene
of it near Amasia, as Eregli, in Karamania, where it
really happened, is about 250 miles from that city. To
appease the indignation of the soldiery at the death of
their favourite, the Grand Vizier Roostem was deposed,
and his office conferred on Achmet Pasha.
Busbecq, during his visit to Amasia, in 1555, witnessed
the conclusion of peace between the Sultan and
the Shah.</p>

<p>The Persian war relieved for a time the pressure
on Hungary. Solyman granted a six months’ armistice,
and Francis Zay and Antony Wranczy or Verantius,
then Bishop of Fünfkirchen, and afterwards
Bishop of Erlau, were sent as envoys to Constantinople.<a name="FNanchor_283_283" id="FNanchor_283_283"></a><a href="#Footnote_283_283" class="fnanchor">283</a>
They arrived in August. They were instructed
to offer a tribute of 150,000 ducats for Hungary
Proper, and 40,000 for Upper Hungary and
Transylvania. The Viziers, however, told them that
the abandonment of all claims to Transylvania was
an indispensable preliminary to opening negotiations.
Malvezzi was accordingly released, and sent to Vienna
to receive further instructions from Ferdinand; and it
was arranged that the peace should be prolonged for five
years, and that on account of the loss of territory Ferdinand
had sustained in Hungary the annual present or
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_276" id="Page_276">276</a></span>tribute should be reduced to 15,000 ducats. The peace
was not to be ratified till Malvezzi’s return, but the truce
was prolonged in the meanwhile.</p>

<p>In May, 1554, Malvezzi was ordered to return, but
he was prevented by illness, and Busbecq was sent in
his stead.<a name="FNanchor_284_284" id="FNanchor_284_284"></a><a href="#Footnote_284_284" class="fnanchor">284</a> He arrived at Constantinople on January
20, 1555, and proceeded in March, with Verantius and
Zay, to the Sultan’s headquarters at Amasia. They
brought him a present of gilded cups, and 10,000
ducats as tribute for Transylvania. They complained
of the numerous breaches of the armistice
on the part of the Turks, but, although they promised
80,000 ducats to the Sultan and large sums to the
chief viziers, they could only obtain an extension of
the armistice for six months, and a letter from Solyman
to Ferdinand, with which Busbecq was sent to
Vienna.</p>

<p>On September 28, 1555, Achmet was executed,
and Roostem reappointed Grand Vizier.<a name="FNanchor_285_285" id="FNanchor_285_285"></a><a href="#Footnote_285_285" class="fnanchor">285</a></p>

<p>Notwithstanding the truce of Amasia, guerilla raids
on both sides continued all along the Hungarian frontiers.
To check the incursions of the Heydons,
Touighoun, the Pasha of Buda,<a name="FNanchor_286_286" id="FNanchor_286_286"></a><a href="#Footnote_286_286" class="fnanchor">286</a> attacked and took
Babocsa; and Ali, his successor, the victor of Fülek,
with the same object, commenced the siege of Szigeth,
on May 24, 1556, and assaulted the place a month
later, but was repulsed with heavy loss. In the meantime
the Palatine Nadasty had besieged Babocsa, and
Ali hastened with a detachment to relieve it, but was
defeated with great loss on the river Rinya (July 25).
Babocsa was then abandoned by the Turks, and
fell into the hands of the Hungarians, who burnt it,
and blew up the citadel. Ali resumed the siege of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_277" id="Page_277">277</a></span>Szigeth, but was so weakened by his defeat, that he was
obliged to raise it, retreating to Buda, where he died soon
afterwards.<a name="FNanchor_287_287" id="FNanchor_287_287"></a><a href="#Footnote_287_287" class="fnanchor">287</a> The fall of Szigeth was thus postponed
for ten years, when it was destined to be associated
with the termination of a more glorious career, and
the extinction of a more famous name.<a name="FNanchor_288_288" id="FNanchor_288_288"></a><a href="#Footnote_288_288" class="fnanchor">288</a></p>

<p>Meanwhile Transylvania had again passed into
the possession of Isabella and her son. She had at
first gone to the Silesian duchies, which Ferdinand
had given in exchange for Transylvania; but she was
dissatisfied with them, and returned to her brother’s
court in Poland, where she entered into correspondence
with her partisans in Transylvania. The current
of feeling there ran strongly in her favour. The
Spaniard, Castaldo, Ferdinand’s governor, was ignorant
of the national laws and usages. His troops were
left unpaid, and supported themselves by plundering
the country. At last one corps after another mutinied
for their pay, and marched out of Transylvania; and
Castaldo himself, unable to check the dissolution of
his army, withdrew to Vienna. For a time anarchy
prevailed in Transylvania; but in June, 1556, the inhabitants
resolved to recall Isabella and her son. The
envoys found her at Lemberg, and invited her to return.
The Voivodes of Moldavia and Wallachia entered
Hungary to protect her passage, and on October
22 she and her son entered Klausenburg in
triumph.<a name="FNanchor_289_289" id="FNanchor_289_289"></a><a href="#Footnote_289_289" class="fnanchor">289</a></p>

<p>Meanwhile Bebek, the representative of Queen
Isabella, was using every means in his power to thwart
the efforts of Busbecq and his colleagues. The latter
returned home in August, 1557. Verantius was rewarded
with the bishopric of Erlau. As far back as
June, 1555, allusions to the prospect of his appoint<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_278" id="Page_278">278</a></span>ment
may be found, and the see had been kept vacant
for him for more than a year before his actual translation
in November, 1557. His office was no sinecure.
He was perpetually occupied in providing for the defence
of his diocese, in writing to the Pasha of Buda
to remonstrate against the continual invasions of the
neighbouring Sanjak-beys, and in counterworking the
intrigues of Zapolya’s party. His remaining time and
energies were devoted to attempts to check the spread
of Lutheranism in his diocese. It may be remarked
here that John Sigismund was much assisted by his
patronage of Lutheranism. His court was the refuge
of many Lutheran, and even of Socinian, teachers.
An anecdote Verantius gives in one of his letters will
show what a hold Lutheranism had obtained in parts
of Hungary. When a fire, supposed to be the work
of an incendiary, broke out in the monastery of Jaszbereny,
most of the inhabitants of the town refused to
help to extinguish it, declaring that they would rather
the Turks had the monastery than the monks. Zay,
the other ambassador, was appointed Governor of
Kaschau.<a name="FNanchor_290_290" id="FNanchor_290_290"></a><a href="#Footnote_290_290" class="fnanchor">290</a></p>

<p>In 1558 the fortress of Tata, near Komorn, eight
miles from the right bank of the Danube, was surprised
by Hamza, Sanjak-bey of Stuhlweissenburg.</p>

<p>Throughout the negotiations the Sultan insisted on
the cession of Szigeth, but was induced in the winter
of 1557 to grant a fresh armistice for seven months.
In 1559 Ferdinand sent by Albert de Wyss<a name="FNanchor_291_291" id="FNanchor_291_291"></a><a href="#Footnote_291_291" class="fnanchor">291</a> four projects
for a treaty, the first of which demanded the restoration
of Tata and Fülek, but the last omitted these
conditions. The last was presented by Busbecq in
the camp at Scutari to Solyman, but was not accepted
by him; and the Sultan, on his return to Constanti<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_279" id="Page_279">279</a></span>nople,
placed Busbecq in a sort of confinement in his
house.</p>

<p>In the beginning of 1559 the health of Queen
Isabella began to fail, and Melchior Balassa, a great
Transylvanian noble, wrote to Ferdinand proposing,
on her death, to place Transylvania in his hands.
This letter was intercepted, and sent to Isabella, who,
having such a proof of the treachery of one of her most
trusted adherents, thought it advisable to open negotiations
with Ferdinand herself, and, with the Sultan’s
approval, did so through her brother the King of
Poland. It was proposed that one of Ferdinand’s
daughters should marry John Sigismund, and that the
latter should have Transylvania and Lower Hungary
(the north-eastern part of Hungary, between Poland
and Transylvania), but should abandon the title of
King. These negotiations were broken off by her
death, which took place at Karlsburg in September,
and an attempt in the following year to renew them
also came to nothing, as John Sigismund refused to
renounce the title of King.</p>

<p>In the winter of 1561 Andrew Bathory persuaded
his brother Nicholas and Melchior Balassa to go over
to Ferdinand’s side.<a name="FNanchor_292_292" id="FNanchor_292_292"></a><a href="#Footnote_292_292" class="fnanchor">292</a> As soon as Ferdinand had recovered
the town of Munkats, Balassa was to receive
it for his life, with the right of maintaining a certain
number of soldiers at Ferdinand’s expense, and, in
return, to give up to Ferdinand various towns immediately
to the north of Transylvania Proper, which were
his possession.</p>

<p>Roostem died in July 1561, and was succeeded by
Ali, who proved much more pliant in his negotiations
with Busbecq, and the latter at last succeeded in ob<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_280" id="Page_280">280</a></span>taining
a peace for eight years. The principal stipulations
of the treaty were as follows:<a name="FNanchor_293_293" id="FNanchor_293_293"></a><a href="#Footnote_293_293" class="fnanchor">293</a></p>

<p>1. Ferdinand to pay an annual tribute of 30,000
ducats, and also the arrears due in respect of the last
two years.</p>

<p>2. The Sultan engaged not to attack Ferdinand
either directly, or by furnishing assistance to John
Sigismund. He also undertook that John Sigismund
should respect the territories of Ferdinand.</p>

<p>3. Melchior Balassa and Nicholas Bathory, and
others in a similar position, who had returned to their
allegiance to Ferdinand, to be included in the peace
with their property and lordships, and to be the vassals
of Ferdinand and John Sigismund conjointly.</p>

<p>4. If any of Ferdinand’s subjects had been expelled
from his property by the adherents of John Sigismund,
or <em>vice versâ</em>, no suits or proceedings to recover such
property to be taken during the peace.</p>

<p>5. If new and otherwise irreconcilable differences
should arise between the contracting parties with regard
to the limits of their jurisdiction, as a provisional arrangement
the <em>de facto</em> subjects of each party at the commencement
of the peace to remain so during its continuance,
and, in particular, certain villages near the
Danube and the fortress of Tata, some of which were
in Ferdinand’s and some in the Sultan’s possession,
to remain respectively as they were, and those in Ferdinand’s
possession not to be molested by the garrison
of Tata.</p>

<p>6. Any Turkish nobles who were in the power of
any of Ferdinand’s officers, either as fugitives or otherwise,
to be released without ransom.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_281" id="Page_281">281</a></span></p>
<p>7. Runaway slaves with any property they might
have stolen to be mutually restored.</p>

<p>8. Ferdinand’s officers to be allowed to fortify and
provision castles, towns, and villages on the borders of
Hungary within their own territories.</p>

<p>9. Disputes about boundaries or the like between
the subjects of the two parties to be settled by arbitration,
and the persons at fault punished as truce-breakers.</p>

<p>10. The treaty to be in force for eight years,
and to be binding upon all the officers and subjects
on both sides, particularly the Voivodes of Moldavia
and Wallachia, and on John Sigismund, and none of
Ferdinand’s subjects or their property to be molested
or injured in any way. Any property taken contrary
to this stipulation to be restored to its owners, and
any person taken prisoner to be released uninjured.</p>

<p>11. Ambassadors and envoys to be granted full permission
to travel in the Sultan’s dominions, with liberty
of ingress and egress to and from his court, and to
be supplied with interpreters.</p>

<p>On the arrival of Busbecq at Frankfort with
Ibrahim, the first dragoman of the Porte, important
differences were found to exist between the Turkish
and Latin texts of the treaty. The former only included
the barons who had already returned to their
allegiance to Ferdinand, and not those who might
afterwards do so; it stipulated for the extradition of
refugees, as well as that of brigands and rebels, and
included the Voivodes of Moldavia and Wallachia.
The Emperor demanded that these points should be
corrected; but his demands seem to have been ineffectual,
and the Turkish incursions on the Hungarian
frontier continued.</p>

<p>Ferdinand died on July 25, 1564, and was succeeded
as Emperor by his son Maximilian, who had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_282" id="Page_282">282</a></span>
been elected King of Hungary and Bohemia in his
father’s lifetime. Fighting still went on between him
and John Sigismund on the frontiers of Transylvania.
Szathmar was taken by the latter, and Tokay<a name="FNanchor_294_294" id="FNanchor_294_294"></a><a href="#Footnote_294_294" class="fnanchor">294</a> and
Serencs by the former. The Grand Vizier Ali, who
was inclined to peace, died in July 1565, and was
succeeded by the more warlike Mehemet Sokolli.
During 1565, the Sultan was fully occupied with the
siege of Malta, but in the beginning of the following
year war was declared against Hungary, Albert de
Wyss, who had succeeded Busbecq as ambassador,
was thrown into prison, and on May 1 Solyman
started from Constantinople on his last campaign.
His age and infirmities obliged him to quit the saddle
for a carriage.</p>

<p>On June 29 he received John Sigismund at Semlin,
and intended to march on Erlau, but, hearing that
Count Nicholas Zriny, the commander at Szigeth, had
surprised and killed the Sanjak-bey of Tirhala, he
resolved to make Szigeth the first object of attack.
The siege commenced on August 5. Two furious
assaults on the 26th and 29th were repulsed with great
slaughter. On September 8, Zriny, finding he could
hold out no longer, set the fortress on fire, sallied forth,
sword in hand, at the head of the garrison, and met a
soldier’s death. The Turks poured into the citadel,
intent on murder and plunder; but the fire reached the
powder-magazine, which blew up, burying in the ruins
more than three thousand men. Solyman did not live
to witness his triumph. His health had long been failing,
and he died on the night of the 5th or 6th of
September. His death was concealed by the Grand
Vizier for three weeks, to give his successor, Selim,
time to reach Constantinople from Kutaiah.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_283" id="Page_283">283</a></span></p>
<p>The death of Solyman seems to form a fitting
termination to this sketch. With the exception of his
successor, Selim, he is the last survivor of the personages
who figure prominently in Busbecq’s pages.
The Emperor Ferdinand, the Grand Viziers Achmet,
Roostem, and Ali, and the unfortunate Bajazet, have
passed away. The greater part of Hungary and
Transylvania continued subject to the successors of
Solyman, either immediately or as a vassal State, till
near the close of the following century. In 1683
Vienna was once more besieged by the Turks, under
the Grand Vizier Kara Mustapha, but was relieved by
John Sobieski. The reaction from this supreme effort
was fatal to the Turkish dominion in Hungary. In
1686 Buda was recaptured by Charles of Lorraine, and
by the Peace of Carlowitz, concluded in 1698, the whole
of Hungary and Transylvania was ceded to the Emperor
Leopold.</p>

<h3>II.<br /><br />

<i>ITINERARIES.</i></h3>

<p class="noindent"><span class="smcap">In</span> describing his first Turkish letter as an ‘iter,’
or itinerary, Busbecq places it under a class of composition
of which there are several examples still extant.
In Busbecq’s days it was a common practice for
scholars to write an account in Latin verse of any
journey they might happen to make. These itineraries
are generally extremely amusing, the writers being
men of keen observation, with a great sense of humour,
and condescending to notice those trifles which are
passed over by the historian.</p>

<p>As an example, Nathan Chytræus gives an account
of his trip to England during the Long Vacation of
the University of Paris. He lands at Rye, and, going
to an inn, eats his first English dinner, which he hugely
enjoys, noticing at the same time the handsome faces
and dignified bearing of the waitresses. On his way
to London he is struck with the comfortable appearance
of the country seats, and specially with the belts
of laurel with which they were surrounded. As he
passes over London Bridge he is delighted with the
handsome shops full of every kind of merchandise
which lined its sides. He visits Westminster Abbey,
and wonders at not finding the tomb of Dr. Linacre,
the celebrated physician, who, though a canon of St.
Peter’s, Westminster, was buried at St. Paul’s. He
goes eastward, and visits the Tower of London, noticing
the menagerie, and specially two lions at the entrance
of the Tower. Of the collection of arms he says that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_285" id="Page_285">285</a></span>
a visitor would imagine it to be the greatest in the
world if he had not seen the Arsenal at Venice. He
has a word for Southwark across the river, telling us
that it was covered with small houses, and the home
of numerous dogs and bears, which were kept for baiting.
He visits Hampton Court, Nonsuch Park,<a name="FNanchor_295_295" id="FNanchor_295_295"></a><a href="#Footnote_295_295" class="fnanchor">295</a> and
Windsor; at the last place Elizabeth was staying, with
all her court. The Queen is duly complimented on her
learning, but he can spare a couple of lines also for the
rabbits which then, as now, were scampering fearlessly
about the Park:</p>

<div class="line">Quin et in effossis habitare cuniculus antris</div>
<div class="line">Assuetus prodire solet camposque vagari.</div>
</div></div></div>

<p>It will be seen that the itinerary of Nathan
Chytræus is written very much in Busbecq’s style,
while there are other itineraries which require notice as
taking us over nearly the same ground as our author.</p>

<p>Among the companions of Veltwick (vol. i. page
<a href="http://www.gutenberg.org/files/53629/53629-h/53629-h.htm#Page_79">79</a>), when he went as Ambassador to Constantinople,
was Hugo Favolius, who has left us an account of the
expedition in Latin hexameters. Having ingeniously
introduced the date 1545 into his verses, he tells us
that was the year—</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="line">Cum decus imperii Romani, Carolus ingens,</div>
<div class="line">Pertæsus belli tandem, metuensque tumultus</div>

<div class="line">Ergo a consiliis regi fidissimus unus</div>
<div class="line">Deligitur sermone potens Veldvicius heros,</div>

<div class="line">Præstanti eloquio et placido sermone Tyranni</div>
<div class="line">In melius si forte queat convertere mentem.</div>
</div></div></div>

<p>After this humiliating confession of the power of the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_286" id="Page_286">286</a></span>Turk, Favolius tells us how they sailed across the Gulf
of Venice and landed at Ragusa. After a short rest
the party travelled over the mountains to Sophia, and
thence to Constantinople. In returning Veltwick made
the journey to Vienna by land, taking, no doubt, the
same route as was afterwards traversed by Busbecq,
while Hugo Favolius and some of the younger members
of the party obtained leave to go back to Venice
by sea.</p>

<p>It seems strange that in a piece of this kind the
writer should so frankly admit the superiority of the
Turkish power; it would appear to be but an ill compliment
to the sovereigns from whom Favolius must
have looked for advancement. In order, however, to
gauge the real amount of terror which the Turks inspired
it is necessary to take the account of P. Rubigal,
the Hungarian, who was attached to an embassy sent
shortly after the death of John Zapolya<a name="FNanchor_296_296" id="FNanchor_296_296"></a><a href="#Footnote_296_296" class="fnanchor">296</a> by the leading
nobles of his party to convey their tribute to
Solyman. Rubigal’s itinerary may be considered to
furnish us with an idea of the position of a Hungarian
in the middle of the sixteenth century. His description
is ludicrous, no doubt, but it is no less horrible.</p>

<p>He begins thus:—</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="line">Tempore concedens quo rex in fata Joannes</div>

</div></div></div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_287" id="Page_287">287</a></span></p>

<p>The party started from Szegedin, on the river
Theiss, going by boat to Belgrade, and thence by land
to Constantinople.</p>

<p>They were entertained at a banquet by Solyman,
and were much disgusted at two things: first, he gave
them sherbet instead of wine; and secondly, at the
conclusion of the banquet he caused the ghastly heads
of men who had been recently executed to be set before
them. The grim pleasantry could not be misunderstood.
The heads, no doubt, were those of Hungarians,
whom Solyman was pleased to regard in the
light of rebels. Whilst at Constantinople Rubigal had
an opportunity of seeing the Turkish fleet, which was
then commanded by the famous Barbarossa. The
Hungarian was evidently horribly frightened at the
formidable preparations of the Turks, for immediately
afterwards he gives his readers plainly to understand
that his tastes are of a domestic turn, and that he has
no hankering after—</p>

<div class="line i5">the perils which environ</div>
<div class="line">The man who meddles with cold iron.</div>

<p>Oddly enough, however, he gives us an account of
two Germans he met with fetters on their legs, who
beg him to tell their friends at home that it will be
the easiest thing in the world to drive the Turks into
the Bosphorus. He gives their message, but cautiously
refrains from either endorsing or contradicting their
opinion.</p>

<p class="noindent"><span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><span class="smcap">Ferdinandus</span> etc., etc., nobili fideli a nobis delecto Augerio
a Busbeck, equiti aurato, Consiliario nostro gratiam nostram
Cæsaream et omne bonum.</span></p>

<p><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">Cum nihil sit inter mortales sublimius Imperiali Majestate
et celsitudine, quam Deus Optimus Maximus cæteris humanis
dignitatibus eminere voluit, ut micantissimis radiis
suis terrarum orbem et commissum Imperium illustret, par
equidem est, ut, quem Deus ad fastigium hoc evexit, is etiam
dignitatem et munus sibi demandatum ita administret, ut,
quantum fieri potest, in hac vita quam proxime accedat ad
exemplum divinæ ejus Majestatis a cujus nutu tota hujus
mundi machina dependet, nullisque finibus clementiam et
liberalitatem suam teneat circumscriptam, sed in omnes eam
exerceat, præcipue, quos summa virtus, prudentia, doctrina,
integritas ac rerum usus aliæque ingenii et animi dotes, nec
non præclara in Rempublicam Christianam merita præ cæteris
claros reddidere, omnem in eo operam et diligentiam adhibendo,
necubi virtutem debitis premiis destituisse videatur.
Etsi enim virtus se ipsa facile sit contenta neque magnopere
indigeat alienæ laudis adminiculo, quam alioquin etiam honos,
amplitudo et gloria ut certissima premia sponte plerumque
sequuntur, fit tamen, ut si quando illa summorum Imperatorum
ac Regum judicio atque decreto comprobetur, multo
illustrior et clarior evadat et alios quoque non tam ad admirationem
quam ad imitationem et studium accendat.</span></p>

<p><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">Qua in re sicuti olim divi prædecessores nostri Romanorum
Imperatores ac Reges omnem adhibuere curam, sic nos
quoque hunc eorum laudatissimum morem secuti in eandem
semper curam et cogitationem incubuimus ut optimorum
virorum de nobis atque Republica bene meritorum virtus a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_296" id="Page_296">296</a></span>
nobis condignis honoribus cohonestaretur. In quorum sane
numero, cum te prefatum <i>Augerium a Busbeck</i> haud postremum
locum obtinere compertum habeamus, æquum est
profecto, ut in te ipso nostram erga tales homines clementissimam
animi propensionem omnibus declaremus, et contestatam
reddemus, idque ejuscemodi ornamenti genere, quod
virtutibus ac meritis tuis quam maxime respondeat. Tu
namque nobili et honesto loco in Belgio natus, ingenii acumen
et vim, quod Deus tibi dedit præstantissimum vitæ morumque
honestate, probitate ac bonarum literarum studiis,
diversitate linguarum multarumque rerum cognitione et aliis
plurimis excellentibusque animi dotibus ita excoluisti, ut ad
gravissima et maxima quæque Reipublicæ negotia exequenda
visus sis aptus esse. Quapropter quum existimaremus te aliquando
nobis magno usui futurum haud gravatim te in aulam
nostram recepimus, ubi quidem nostræ de te expectationi non
modo cumulate satisfecisti, sed eam longe quoque superavisti.
Cum enim superioribus annis nobis occurrissent ardua
quædam negocia, de quibus a nobis mittendus erat ad Solymannum
Turcharum Principem Orator, qui fide, prudentia,
rerum usu atque industria præstaret, te ex Anglia revocatum,
quo tunc temporis jussu nostro profectus fueras, ad id
muneris suscepimus, quo magna tua cum laude et ingenti
nostro ac Regnorum Dominiorumque nostrorum imo totius
Reipublicæ Christianæ commodo octo annos functus es,
confecta ad postremum inter nos et ipsum Turcharum principem
octennali pace. In qua legatione quas sustinueris
curas, incommoditates, molestias, quos tuleris labores, quæ
vitæ pericula subieris, quam etiam ostenderis in rebus agendis
ingenii vim, quam fidem, quam solicitudinem, quam
solertiam, prudentiam et industriam, quam intrepidi animi
constantiam, et qua denique usus sis pietate in redimendis,
juvandis et fovendis miseris Christianis, qui Constantinopolim
tuo tempore in fœdam captivitatem adducti fuerunt,
magno etiam fortunarum tuarum dispendio, nimis longum
foret sigillatim recensere. Illud profecto consecutus es, quod
non omnibus qui talem provinciam suscipiunt, ne dicamus
perpaucis, contingere solet, ut non modo a nobis ac Serenissimis
filiis nostris et aliis sacri Romani Imperii Principibus,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_297" id="Page_297">297</a></span>
statibus et ordinibus summam gratiam iniveris, verum etiam
ipsismet Turcis propter virtutes tuas, quas naturæ instinctu
in te prospexere et admirati sunt, valde gratus exstiteris.
Quare merito probandum est præclarum de te judicium
Serenissimi Principis Domini Maximiliani secundi, Romanorum
ac Hungariæ et Bohemiæ, etc., Regis, Archiducis
Austriæ, etc., filii nostri charissimi, in eo, quod te dignum et
idoneum reputaverit, quem Dapiferis Serenissimorum filiorum
suorum Rudolfi et Ernesti, Archiducum Austriæ, charissimorum
nepotum nostrorum cum profisciscerentur in Hispaniam
præficeret. Quod si ergo olim apud veteres, qui luctu
et saltu in Olympiaco stadio celebres athletæ virium suarum
specimen aliquod egregium edidissent, divinis propemodum
honoribus affici, qui vero in bello vel murum primi ascendissent
vel civem morti seduxissent corona vel murali vel
civica donari soliti fuerunt, et nostra quoque ætate, qui vel
cum hoste singulari certamine congressus victor evasit vel
in prelio strenuam præ ceteris operam navavit vel alias rem
bellicam caute et recte administravit, auratæ militiæ titulis
insignitur, quanto magis tu, Augeri, tali dignitate condecorandus
fuisti, cui non cum uno homine nec uno prelio per
unum aut alterum mensem res gerenda, sed totos octo annos
cum gente Christiano nomini infensissima adeoque cum
ejusdem gentis Principe potentissimo ac pluribus victoriis et
successibus elato, cumque ipsius præcipuis consiliariis et
ministris, callidissimis et versipellibus diesque noctesque
acerrime dimicandum fuit, quorum potentiam et nefarios
impetus tu, divino adjutus auxilio, tua prudentia, industria
ac rerum agendarum dexteritate postpositis quibuslibet
periculis infracto animo sustinuisti et a cervicibus Regnorum
et Dominiorum nostrorum avertisti. Quæ cum ita se habeant
optimo certe consilio factum est quod præfatus Serenissimus
Romanorum Rex superiore mense Septembri, quando paterna
voluntate nostra Rex Hungariæ renunciatus publicatus ac
Regali corona insignitus fuit, te publice in spectantibus et
grato applausu probantibus ac suffragantibus prælatis, proceribus,
Ordinibus et Statibus ejus Regni nostri, quorum
saluti et incolumitati potissimum studueras, ictu ter vibrati

creaverit, quia te et eo et alias longe clarioribus ornamentis
dignum censemus. Et licet ad perpetuam gloriam tibi
sufficere queat publicus ille Serenissimi filii nostri Romanorum
Regis actus neque is ulla approbatione Cæsareæ et
paternæ auctoritatis nostræ opus habeat, pro nostra tamen
in te mirifica benignitate volumus te eam dignitatem ab

de Daniel de Croix Escuyer filz de Geraerd Seigneur de
Wambrechies, jeusne homme à marier, contenant que ledit
suppliant s’est, à certain jour passé, trouvé avecq George
Giselin Seigneur de Bouzebecque Jacques de Sauch et autres
en la ville de Comines vers le Seigneur de Halewyn. Lesquelz
ilz ont servi en leur jonesse. Or est que à certain
jour de feste du soir que lors on s’estoit esbatu au chasteau
du dit lieu, entre huyt et neuf heures du soir, le dit
Seigneur de Hallewyn avec le Seigneur de Croisille se
retirèrent au dit chastel pour eulx coucher. Et quant au
dit suppliant, George Giselin et Jacques de le Sauch, ilz
se retirèrent vers le marchié avec Jehan Homme, Bailli
du dit lieu, et les sievoit feu alors vivant Charlot Desrumaulx,
joueur du luut, qui démonstroit avoir assez fort beu,
et en allant leur chemin, l’un d’entre eulx mist en bouche
aux autres d’aller bancquetter à la maison d’ung nommé
maistre Franche Barbier demourant auprès dudit marchié,
à quoy ilz saccordèrent et allèrent tous ensemble celle part,
où ilz furent syevis par le dit Charlot sans y estre appellé.
Que lors les dits suppliant et de le Sauch, qui alloient devant
vers la dite maison, le dit Suppliant ayant son esprivier sur
son poing, prièrent au dit Charlot, obstant qu’il estoit noyseulx
après boire, qu’il se retirast et allast couchier, et qu’ilz
ne le voloient point avoir, ce qu’il ne voloit faire, mais entra
en la dicte maison, parquoy le dit Suppliant le print par le
col et le poussa hors de la dite maison à l’ayde du dit Jacques,
dont il se courroucha et se mist en tous debvoirs de tyrer son<span class="pagenum2"><a name="Page_306" id="Page_306">306</a></span>
baston pour les villonner, mais il fut empesché par le dit
Jacques, et soubit survint le dit bailli qui le print au corps,
mais finablement soubz promesse qu’il fist de soy partir et
aller couchier, le dit bailli à la requeste des assistans le laissa
aller, et lui estant hors des mains du dit bailli se tyra d’un
lez oudit marchié contre une maison ou sur ung bancq, il
mist son luut et desvesty sa robbe tira sa dagge et proféra
plusieurs haultaines langaiges sentans menaces disant, ou
parolles en substance, qu’il estoit homme pour respondre
au plus hardy de eulx tous. Et craindant par le dit Daniel,
suppliant le débat appant contre lui bailla son oiseau à son
homme, et ainsi qu’il estoit sur le marchié, il veyt ledit
deffunct qui continuoit du dit langaiges haultains au deshonneur
de lui et des autres. Disant qu’il estoit homme
pour le plus hardy, ayant sa dage nue marcha vers lui comme
aussi fist le dit deffunct. Que lors le dit Suppliant ayant
son sang meslé, et mémoratif que lui qui estoit josne noble
homme sievant les armes, se il se retiroit pour ung menestrel
de basse condition ce lui seroit à toujours reproché en villonnie
entre tous nobles hommes. En ceste chaleur, non
puissant de la refrener ayant aussi son baston nud, frappèrent
l’un après l’autre aucuns cops et fut attaint par le dit deffunct
sur l’espaule, et du cop que icellui suppliant rua, il attaindit
ledit deffunct en la mesmelle, dont brief après il termina vie
par mort. Pour lequel cas le dit suppliant a esté appellé à

<p><a name="Footnote_5_5" id="Footnote_5_5"></a><a href="#FNanchor_5_5"><span class="label">5</span></a> Nearly twelve years have elapsed since we parted company with
Busbecq on his return from Turkey. A sketch of his life during this interval
will be found in vol. i. pp. <a href="http://www.gutenberg.org/files/53629/53629-h/53629-h.htm#Page_59">59</a>-64. We there expressed some doubt
as to whether there was any trustworthy authority for his visit to Spain in
attendance on the younger Archdukes; we have, however, since obtained
evidence of it in the Archduke Albert’s decree, creating the Barony of Bousbecque.
In it are recited Busbecq’s services, and amongst them this visit
is mentioned. The date of the decree is September 30, 1600, and it states
that the visit took place twenty-five years before. This is obviously an
error, as we can account for his time from August 1574 to February 1576;
in all probability the true date of the visit lies between the years 1570,
when Albert and Wenceslaus went to Spain with their sister Anne on her
marriage to Philip II., and 1572, when we find Busbecq residing at
Vienna. See vol. i. p. <a href="http://www.gutenberg.org/files/53629/53629-h/53629-h.htm#Page_62">62</a>.</p></div>

Vienna, where Maximilian, through Pibrac, made overtures to him, offering
the hand of his daughter, the widowed Queen. Henry was under
such great obligations to Maximilian, that he was disinclined to give
a downright refusal. <cite>Thuanus</cite>, iii. p. 8. The following quotation from
an account of Busbecq’s Queen will show what these obligations were.
‘<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Or, estant veufve, plusieurs personnes d’hommes et dames de la Court,
des plus clair voyans que je sçay, eurent opinion que le Roy, à son retour
de Pologne, l’espouseroit, encore qu’elle fust sa belle sœur; car il le
pouvoit par la dispense du Pape, qui peut beaucoup en telles matieres, et
sur tout à l’endroit des grands, à cause du bien public qui en sort. Et y
avoit beaucoup de raisons que ce mariage se fist, lesquelles je laisse à
deduire aux plus hauts discoureurs, sans que je les allegue. Mais, entre
autres, l’une estoit pour recognoistre par ce mariage les obligations
grandes que le Roy avoit reçeues de l’Empereur à son retour et depart de
Pologne; car il ne faut point douter que, si l’Empereur eust voulu luy
donner le moindre obstacle du monde, il n’eust jamais peu partir ny
passer ny se conduire seurement en France. Les Polonnois le vouloient
retenir s’il ne fust party sans leur dire adieu; car les Allemans le guettoient
de toutes parts pour l’attrapper (comme fut ce brave roy Richard
d’Angleterre, retournant de la Terre Saincte, ainsi que nous lisons en nos
chroniques), et l’eussent tout de mesme arresté prisonnier et faict payer
rançon, ou possible pis; car ils luy en vouloient fort, à cause de la
feste de la Sainct Barthelemy, au moins les princes protestans.</span>’—<cite lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Brantôme</cite>,

Duke of Vendôme, or at most, the titular King of Navarre. The greater
part of the kingdom had been seized by Ferdinand the Catholic in 1515,
and has ever since been held by the Kings of Spain. Henry’s power
was derived from his position as a great French noble, the first Prince of
the blood after the King’s brother, and from his vast possessions in
France, and not from the fragment of Navarre from which he derived
his title. Subjoined is a short sketch of his family:—<br /><br />

Cossé took part in Guise’s famous defence of Metz in 1552, was
appointed <em lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">surintendant des finances</em> in 1563, and Marshal in 1567. He
fought at St. Denis and Moncontour, but was defeated by Coligny at
Arny-le-Duc in 1570. He died in 1582, aged 70. According to Brantôme
(ii. 434), he remarked on his imprisonment: ‘<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Je ne sçay pas ce que
M. de Montmorency peut avoir faict, mais quant à moy, je sçay bien que
je n’ay rien faict pour estre prisonnier avec luy, sinon pour luy tenir
compagnie quand on le fera mourir, et moy avec luy; que l’on me fera
de mesmes que l’on faict bien souvent à de pauvres diables, que l’on
pend pour tenir compagnie seulement à leurs compagnons, encor qu’ilz
n’ayent rien meffaict.</span>’</p></div>

who was a Protestant, he had a son and four daughters, one of whom,
Charlotte, married the Prince of Orange. See Letter <a href="#xixa">XIX</a>. and note.

of Lusignan, which gave kings to Jerusalem and Cyprus. In the keep of
the château was a fountain, said to be haunted by the fairy Melusine, the
ancestress and tutelary genius of the family. According to the legend,
the founder of the family first met her by a forest spring. Before she became
his wife she exacted a promise from him that he would not attempt
to see her on the Saturday in every week, or to find out where she had
gone. For a time all went on well, but unfortunately the husband was at
last persuaded to peep into the room to which Melusine had retired. To
his horror he discovered that on every Saturday half her body was transformed
into a serpent. Finding the secret was no longer hers, she thrice
flew round the château, and then vanished. She was believed to appear
at times on the keep of the <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">château</span>, and whenever she was seen it was
said to presage a death, either in the Lusignan family or in the Royal
family of France.

Lusignan is situated about fourteen English miles south-west of
Poitiers. De l’Estoile, i. 49, gives some details of the siege and capitulation.

With the exception of the Marquisate of Saluzzo, they were the last
remains of the French conquests beyond the Alps. The Duchess of
Savoy was Margaret, daughter of Francis I., and therefore aunt to

first important German prince who embraced Calvinism, and was the
head of that sect in Germany. His Court was the asylum of the French
and Flemish exiles. When Henry III. passed through Germany on his
way to Poland, he visited Heidelberg at the Palatine’s invitation. He
found the gates of the town guarded, the streets lined with soldiers,
match in hand, and no one to receive him at the Castle except armed
men. Halfway up the stairs he was met by the Rhinegrave, attended by
two of the survivors of the Massacre of Saint Bartholomew. The Rhinegrave
asked him on the Elector’s behalf to excuse his coming down, on
account of indisposition. Henry found him at the entrance of the room
supported by a gentleman, in the attitude of a man who finds it a great
effort to stand upright. ‘<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">On n’y pouvoit entrer sans jetter la veüe sur un
grand Tableau de la mort de l’Admiral, et des principaux Seigneurs tués à
Paris. Voyant que le Roi portoit sa veüe de ce costé, il poussa un grand souspir,
et dit tout haut, “Ceux qui les ont fait mourir sont bien malheureux,
croyez qu’ils estoient gens de bien et grands Capitaines.” Le Roy respondit
doucement, “Qu’ils estoient capables de bien faire s’ils eussent
voulu.” Ce Prince sentoit un grand contentement en son ame de pouvoir
faire esclatter l’excez de sa passion en la presence du Roy, il en fit voir
les effets en diverses façons, lui donna à souper, et le servit de poisson,
mais il n’eut pour Gentilhomme que ceux qu’on luy dit avoir eschappé

the King up and down the great hall of the Castle, with a firm step and
in perfect health, so as to show that his indisposition of the previous
evening had been entirely feigned.—Matthieu, <cite lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Histoire de France</cite>, i. p.
363. The Palatine’s second son, John Casimir, born in 1543, is a prominent
figure in the religious wars of the time. He was one of the military
adventurers who hoped in the general confusion to win themselves a
throne by their sword. He conducted several expeditions to the aid of
the French Protestants, and was one of the many princes suggested as
a husband for Queen Elizabeth. At her instigation he was given the
command of the German army which entered the Netherlands in 1578.

à faire lever le poids d’un canon par une petite machine qu’un enfant de
six ans tenoit entre ses mains. Comme elle étoit fort attentive à cette
operation, je me mis à considérer un marbre noir de sept pieds en quarré,
qui servoit de table au bon Seigneur de Candale; et ayant apperçu un

the briefest outline of the principal events in the life of this famous Breton
chief. He was born in 1531, and became a Protestant in 1558. In 1561
he was one of the French nobles who escorted Marie Stuart to Scotland.
Brantôme was another of the suite. In 1570 he was wounded by a musket-shot
at the siege of Fontenay; gangrene set in, and it was found necessary
to amputate his left arm; Jeanne d’Albret, Queen of Navarre, held
the shattered limb during the operation. This arm was replaced by one
of iron, whence he obtained the famous sobriquet, by which he is best
known, <cite lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Bras de fer</cite>. In 1573 Charles IX. sent him to La Rochelle in the
hope he would be able to effect some compromise with the citizens, and
he was for some time regarded with suspicion by both sides; but he
appears to have always acted an honest and straightforward part in a
very delicate position. When he found a reconciliation was impossible,
he placed his sword once more at the service of the French Protestants.
He fought for the Protestant cause not only in France but also in the
Netherlands, was Count Louis of Nassau’s right-hand man at the surprise
and subsequent siege of Mons in 1572, and at one time, in 1579, occupied
Bousbecque and the places in the neighbourhood, Menin, Comines,
Wervicq, &amp;c. He was mortally wounded at the siege of Lamballe, in
Brittany, and died on August 4, 1591. Thuanus (v. p. 180) calls him
‘a truly great man, who for bravery, prudence, and military knowledge
deserved to be compared with the greatest generals of the time,
and for the purity of his life, his moderation, and his justice to be preferred
to most of them.’ For a further account of him see Letters to
Rodolph, <a href="#ix">IX.</a> and <a href="#liv">LIV.</a>, note.</p></div>

Fieschi were Counts of Lavagna, and one of the four principal families of

incidents of Genoese history. The object of the conspirators was to
overthrow the power of Andrew Doria, and to detach Genoa from the
Imperialists, and bring the republic into close connection with France.
The conspiracy miscarried, owing to its leader, Count John Louis Fiesco,
falling from the planks by which he was boarding a galley, and being
drowned. Owing to the darkness of the night the accident was not discovered
till it was too late to assist him. His brothers were executed

1557, when he was only three years old. At the time Busbecq wrote he
was a gallant young man of twenty, dreaming of great exploits as a
Crusader. Four years later he attempted to put his ideas into practice,
and invaded Africa with a large force. His army was annihilated in the
battle of Alcazar (August 4th, 1578), and the brave young King perished
on the field. His romantic end produced a deep impression on his subjects.
‘It may be mentioned,’ says the <cite>Times</cite> (December 1825), ‘as a
singular species of infatuation, that many Portuguese residing in Brazil,
as well as in Portugal, still believe in the coming of Sebastian, the romantic
king, who was killed about the year 1578, in a pitched battle with
the Emperor Muley Moluc. Some of these old visionaries will go out
wrapped in their large cloaks, on a windy night, to watch the movements
of the heavens, and frequently, if an exhalation is seen flitting in the air,
resembling a falling star, they will cry out, “There he comes!”’ For a

at Venice from 1546 to 1550, and was rewarded for his services by receiving
the Bishopric of Orleans in 1552. After he became bishop, the
Chapter of his cathedral, by a statute passed in November 1552, ordered
him to shave off his beard. He refused to comply, and the quarrel raged
fiercely for four years, till finally in 1556 it was appeased by a letter
from the King to the Chapter, in which he declared that he required
to send Morvilliers to various countries in which a beard was necessary,
and therefore ordered the Chapter to receive him beard and all. He did
not, however, take possession of his cathedral till 1559. Francis II.
appointed him a Privy Councillor, and in 1561 he took part in the Conference
of Poissy, and in the following year attended the Council of
Trent, as one of the French representatives. He was afterwards ambassador
to the Duke of Savoy, and in 1564 was one of the negotiators of
the Treaty of Troyes, between Charles IX. and Queen Elizabeth. In the
same year he gave up his Bishopric in favour of his nephew. On the
disgrace of the Chancellor <cite lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">l’Hôpital</cite>, in 1568, he became Keeper of the
Seals, but in 1571 had to resign them to Birague. In de Thou’s opinion
(iii. 209), he was honest and prudent, but cautious to the verge of timidity,
and therefore always pursued a policy of expediency. He was the head
of the party who were in favour of peace but thought no religious reform
was required, and who therefore, in order to remain on good terms with
the extreme Catholic party headed by the Guises, did not hesitate to
evade or violate the pledges given to the Protestants. See <cite>Thuanus</cite>, iii.
35. De Thou’s estimate of his character is borne out by a State-paper
preserved by <cite lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">d’Aubigné</cite> (<cite lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Histoire</cite>, vol. ii. bk. i. ch. ii.), written by Morvilliers
at the request of Charles IX. in 1572, in opposition to Coligny’s

afraid that this fact might be adduced as a reason for not paying her dower
now she was a widow; and also, in case of the failure of Maximilian’s issue
male, a claim might be set up on behalf of her daughter, that Elizabeth’s
renunciation of her rights of succession was invalid for the same reason.
That Busbecq’s fears were not ill-founded is shown by the fact that Louis

him a Marshal, and gave him the command of his forces in Dauphiny.

his banishment, he went no further than Piedmont, entered the Duke of
Savoy’s service, and with his assistance took possession of the Marquisate
of Saluzzo, the last of the French conquests beyond the Alps, driving
out Birague, the Governor. Afterwards the Duke of Savoy, accompanied

the people turned out to hunt the banditti. Pibrac was now in great
danger, as the brigands threatened to kill him if one of their party should
be hurt. From noon to midnight he was compelled to accompany Brysach

The country of Montbéliard, or Mümpelgard, lay between Franche

of Christina, the widowed Duchess of Milan, and daughter of Elizabeth
of Denmark, sister of Charles V. (see vol. i. page <a href="http://www.gutenberg.org/files/53629/53629-h/53629-h.htm#Page_26">26</a>, note 2), for whose
hand Henry VIII. had been negotiating. She is reported to have declined
his offer, saying, ‘if she had had two heads one should have been at the
service of the King of England, but as she had only one, she preferred to
keep it on her own shoulders.’ Holbein’s portrait now belongs to the
Duke of Norfolk, and was exhibited at the Winter Exhibition of the
Royal Academy in 1880. The lady afterwards married Francis Duke of
Lorraine, and became the mother of Charles Duke of Lorraine and
Dorothea, the wife of Duke Eric of Brunswick. Hence came the connection
between the Houses of Austria and Lorraine, alluded to on page

Montmorency’s relations had good reasons for their apprehensions.
It was intended to strangle him, and, to cover the murder, Miron, chief
physician to the King, was sent to see him, and told to give out that he

was selected as his executioner, and to his reluctance to undertake the

Montmorency was conscious of his danger. ‘Tell the Queen,’ said

his position more than anything else is the fact that two of the most important

Dauphiny, was born about 1530. One of his sisters became a Protestant,
and took refuge in Geneva. He pursued her thither, declaring that
he would either bring her back a Catholic or kill her; but instead of reclaiming
her, he fell under the influence of Beza and became himself a
convert. In 1560 he raised a small partisan force, with which he carried
on a guerilla war in Dauphiny and the Vivarais. His young wife accompanied
him on these expeditions, as the camp was her safest abode. He
took an active part in the civil wars, and fought bravely at Jarnac and
Moncontour.
</p>
<p>
The affair mentioned in the text was a mere skirmish. Montbrun
was engaged in hot pursuit of the King’s troops, whom he had defeated
a few days before (see page <a href="#Page_78">78</a>), when a daring attempt was made
by a party of the royal cavalry to seize the bridge of Gervane, and cut
off his retreat. Though he had only a small force in hand, he charged
the enemy, but finding himself outnumbered was compelled to retreat.
His horse fell in trying to leap a ditch, and he was taken prisoner. Busbecq’s
account shows that the affair was represented in Paris as a decisive
victory. Compare Thuanus, iii. 94, who also states that Montbrun
was the first to raise the Huguenot standard after Saint Bartholomew.
D’Aubigné (<cite lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Histoire</cite>, vol. ii. bk. ii. ch. ix.) says he will give him no
eulogy except the title La Noue conferred upon him—to wit, the Valiant
Montbrun.</p></div>

au troisiesme il y alla. Lors qu’elle le sentit à la porte elle fit semblant

ma tante et sa gouvernante, la fit tourner vers le Roy, envers lequel
elle fit de la froide, et ne luy dict pas deux mots: et s’en estant departi
d’avec elle, sa gouvernante se corrouçant contre elle, luy demanda pourquoy

<p><a name="Footnote_94_94" id="Footnote_94_94"></a><a href="#FNanchor_94_94"><span class="label">94</span></a> According to Mezeray, <cite lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Histoire de France</cite>, iii. 380, and Amyraut,
<cite>Life of La Noue</cite>, 166, his real name was Dianovitz, and he was a Bohemian
by birth (Bohesme, Boësme, Besme). He is, however, generally
called simply Besme. Brantôme, who knew him well, tells us he was a
page of the Cardinal de Guise, and married an illegitimate daughter of
the Cardinal de Lorraine, a former maid of honour to Elizabeth of
France, Queen of Philip II., who gave her a marriage portion. Two
years afterwards he was sent to Spain, by Guise, under the pretext of
buying horses, but in reality, it was said, to renew the secret alliance
which had existed between Philip and the late Cardinal de Lorraine. According
to Brantôme, he went ‘<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">tant pour querir son mariage que pour
braver et se monstrer en piaffe devant le Roy et les Espagnols, et dire que
c’estoit luy qui avoit faict le coup de M. l’Admiral.</span>’ On his return he was
taken prisoner between Barbezieux and Chasteauneuf, and brought to the
Castle of Bouteville. Being recognised, he offered a large sum for his
ransom, and to get Montbrun exchanged against himself. The Guises,
too, made great efforts to obtain his release. However, when news
came of Montbrun’s execution, the inhabitants of Rochelle, ‘qui le
vouloient acheter pour en faire faire justice exemplaire’ (<cite lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">De l’Estoile</cite>, i. 83),
offered 1,000 crowns for him to Bertoville, the Governor of Bouteville.
The latter, for fear of reprisals against the Huguenot prisoners, did not
wish to put him to death openly, and, on the other hand, had no intention
of letting him go unpunished for the murder of Coligny. He therefore
had recourse to the following stratagem. He caused one of his soldiers
to enter into communication with Besme, and to agree for a bribe to let
him escape. The soldier then reported Besme’s plans to the Governor,
who posted an ambush where the fugitive was to pass. He fell into their
hands and was killed on the spot. For an account of his murder of
Coligny, see <cite lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Brantôme</cite>, iii. 280.</p></div>

influence over his master. On his return from Poland, whither
du Guast had accompanied him, Henry gave him the bishoprics of
Amiens and Grenoble. The former ‘<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">il vendit à une garse de la Cour la
somme de 30,000 francs: aiant vendu auparavant l’évesché de Grenoble
40,000 francs au fils du feu seingneur d’Avanson.</span>’—<cite lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">De l’Estoile</cite>, i. 39.
The King also gave him 50,000 livres he had raised by a forced loan
from the Councillors and Advocates of the Parliament and Châtelet at
Paris (<cite lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">De l’Estoile</cite>, i. 54). <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">De l’Estoile</span>, i. 92, gives an account of his
murder. ‘<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Il fust tué dans sa maison à Paris, rue Saint-Honoré, et avec
lui son valet de chambre et un sien laquais, par certains hommes armés
et masqués, qui l’assassinèrent à coups d’espées et de dagues, sans estre
congneus ne retenus. Il dit, mourant, que c’estoit le baron de Viteaux,
qui estoit à Monsieur, qui l’avoit tué: toutefois cela ne fust point avéré,
encores que la présumption en fust grande, et que ce coup avoit esté fait
soubs bon adveu et par commandement; d’autant que ce mignon superbe
et audacieux, enflé de la faveur de son maistre, avoit bravé Monsieur
jusques à estre passé un jour devant lui en la rue Sainct-Antoine, sans le
saluer ni faire semblant de le congnoistre, et avoit dit par plusieurs fois
qu’il ne recongnoissoit que le Roy, et que quand il lui auroit commandé
de tuer son propre frère, qu’il le feroit.</span>’ <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">De l’Estoile</span> makes the reflection
that, as he had shed much innocent blood at the Massacre of Saint Bartholomew,
so according to the word of God his own was shed, and that he
himself was surprised and killed in his bed in the same manner as
he used to boast he then surprised and killed others. Six months
before the murder, Brantôme, who was an intimate friend of both parties,
had made an attempt to induce du Guast to withdraw his opposition to
the pardon which de Viteaux was anxious to obtain for the murder of
Millaud. (See page <a href="#Page_189">189</a> and notes.) He thus concludes his account
of the murder: ‘Pour fin, le baron de Viteaux après avoir fait son coup,
sort si heureusement du logis, et se retira si bien et sans aucun bruit,
qu’on n’en soupçonna celuy qui avoit fait le coup que par conjectures,
tant il fut fait secrettement, et ne se put jamais guieres bien prouver;
mesmes à moy, qui luy estois amy intime, ne me l’a voulu confesser.’—<cite lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Brantôme</cite>,
vi. 93. The Baron de Viteaux was a notorious duellist; his
death is described by Busbecq (pages 189, 190). Du Guast was hated
by Alençon, and his sister Marguerite. The former’s income depended
on the favourite’s pleasure, ‘<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">mon frere n’ayant eu jusques alors son
appennage, et s’entretenant seulement de certaines pensions mal assignées,
qui venoient seulement quand il plaisoit au Guast</span>’ (<cite lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Mémoires de
Marguerite</cite>, p. 63). He had also got Marguerite into scrapes, and was
the deadly enemy of her lover, Bussy d’Amboise. All the evidence
points strongly to the fact that he was murdered at her instigation. Not
only do Thuanus (iii. 108-9) and Mezeray (<cite lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Histoire de France</cite>, iii.
391) give graphic accounts of her visit to de Viteaux at the monastery
of the Augustins at Paris, where he had taken sanctuary, and tell
how she persuaded him by her caresses to commit the murder, but her
friend Brantôme, while he praises her for not oftener availing herself of
this means of punishing her enemies, and asserts that she never retaliated
on du Guast, makes the following admission (v. 187): ‘<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Il est vray que
lors qu’on l’eut tué, et qu’on luy vint annoncer, elle estant malade</span>’ (she
had a bad cold, <cite lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Mémoires</cite>, p. 66), ‘<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">elle dict seulement “Je suis bien
marrie que je ne suis bien guerie pour de joye solemniser sa mort.</span>”’ In
her <cite lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Mémoires</cite> (p. 79), she alludes to du Guast’s death only incidentally,
but at the same time leaves on record unmistakeable evidence of her
feelings towards him. ‘<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Le Guast lors estoit mort, ayant esté tué par un
jugement de Dieu, pendant qu’il suoit une diette, comme aussy c’estoit
un corps gasté de toutes sortes de villanies, qui fust donné à la pourriture
qui des longtemps le possedoit, et son ame aux dæmons, à qui il avoit
faict hommage par magie et toutes sortes de meschancetez.</span>’</p></div>

is close to Châtelherault, on October 1. Châtelherault is therefore probably

acquired at the battle of Château Thierry. With 10,000 infantry and
1,000 heavy cavalry, he attacked Thoré, whose troops did not number
more than 2,500; even of these some had been tampered with and went
over to the Duke. Neither was the way in which he received the wound
which gave him the soubriquet of ‘le Balafré’ much to his credit as
a soldier. The struggle had been decided, and he was engaged in hunting
down one of the fugitives in a thicket of brambles, when the man
turned and shot him in the face. See <cite>Thuanus</cite>, iii. 105-6.

afterwards entered the royal service and fought for the king at Moncontour.
He was next employed on a mission to the German Princes

Henry III. to Poland, as his Seneschal. He was one of those who persuaded
Henry IV. to go to Mass, and took a prominent part in the negotiations
for peace between him and his rebellious subjects. He was on
several occasions employed as the agent of the French Government for
raising German troops. When Busbecq saw him he had just come to
Paris with Bassompierre and Count Mansfeldt to conclude a bargain
with the King for a levy of 8,000 mercenaries.

with the character of his mistress, require some little additions in order
to place before the reader an adequate idea of this good and interesting
lady. She was born June 5, 1554, and was consequently a baby of a few
months old when Busbecq started for the East. She was married to
Charles IX. of France, Nov. 26, 1570, when she was but sixteen. In her
new sphere she quickly won the respect and love of all who knew her.
Two years after her marriage, and just before the birth of her daughter,
came the Massacre of Saint Bartholomew. During that awful night she was
quietly sleeping, unaware of the horrors that were passing around her.
Next morning she heard the news, ‘<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Hélas, dit-elle soudain, le Roy
mon mary, le sçait-il?—Ouy, madame, repondit-on: c’est luy mesme
qui le fait faire.—O mon Dieu! s’escria-t-elle, qu’est cecy? et quels
conseillers sont ceux-là qui luy ont donné tel advis? Mon Dieu, je te
supplie et te requiers de luy vouloir pardonner; car, si tu n’en as
pitié, j’ay grande peur que cette offense ne luy soit pas pardonnée.</span>’—<cite lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Brantôme</cite>,
v. 297.
</p>
<p>
During her husband’s last illness it was noticed that when she
came to see him she did not take a seat by his pillow, but chose the
position from which she could best gaze at the loved features; she did not
speak, no sound passed her lips, but ever and anon she raised her handkerchief
to her face, and wiped away the silent tears; even the hardened
courtiers were touched by this picture of agony suppressed. After
her husband’s death it was observed by one of the women of her bedchamber
that she constantly took the little silver candlestick, which
served as a night-light, inside the curtains of her bed, and as soon as she
thought her attendants were asleep, she knelt up to read and pray. It is
interesting to find that during her widowhood she became a diligent
reader of the Bible. After her return to Vienna she founded the Nunnery
of Santa Clara, where she resided till the time of her death, which took
place January 22, 1592, in the 38th year of her age. See vol. i. p. <a href="#Page_70">70</a>.
</p>
<p>
One story yet remains to be told. She had known Marguerite de
Valois in the pride of her beauty; towards the end of her days she heard
of her as an outcast from her family, poor and desolate. If her own relations
deserted her, her sister-in-law was not forgetful of the poor fallen
woman. She not only sent her kind messages, but most generously bestowed
on her one half of her French revenues. It seems strange that so
warm and loving a nature should ever have been accused of heartlessness
(see note, p. 56). In spite of the silence and reserve which marked her
character she was, beyond all doubt, a most affectionate daughter, a
thoughtful mother, and a devoted wife.</p></div>

account for this gap in the correspondence. Meanwhile he had been
engaged in watching the Queen’s interests in France, and no doubt also
in enforcing the admirable rule of which he was probably the suggester.
The Queen had the right of appointing certain officers and judges in the
towns and districts from which her revenues were derived. Such posts
were commonly bought and sold, but Elizabeth gave strict directions that
no such traffic should be allowed with regard to the appointments of which
she had the patronage. See <cite>Thuanus</cite>, iii. 87.</p></div>

killed in battle against the Moors on the field of Alcazar. By his
death the crown devolved on his uncle Henry, the Cardinal, who, though
nearly seventy years old, at first thought of marrying; this project was
stopped by Philip of Spain; he then appointed a council of regency
to arrange the succession. The two most prominent candidates were
Philip of Spain, who had the best right by blood, but who was most unpopular
in Portugal, and Don Antonio, Prior of Crato, the illegitimate
son of Luis, Duke of Beja, brother of the reigning King. Don Antonio
received the support of the representatives of the people, but, on the
death of Henry in 1580, he was quickly driven out of Portugal by Alva, and
took refuge alternately in France and England, where he received countenance
and support from Henry III. and Elizabeth. The French expedition
to the Azores is frequently mentioned in Busbecq’s letters. The
importance of these islands consisted in their affording a station for ships
coming home either from America or India. We learn from a contemporary
historian (<cite lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Histoire de Portugal</cite>, 1610), that Catherine de Medici
had agreed with Antonio to accept Brazil in settlement of her claims on
the Portuguese throne (see note, page 161), hence the interest which she
took in this expedition, at the head of which she placed her gallant cousin
Philip Strozzi, with de Brissac, son of the Maréchal de Brissac, as his
lieutenant. They were attacked off St. Michael’s by a greatly superior
force of Spanish ships under Santa Cruz; de Brissac cut his way through
and escaped, Don Antonio contrived to be absent, and Strozzi and Don
Antonio’s Constable, the Count of Vimioso, were wounded and captured.
The latter, being a relation of Santa Cruz, was kindly treated, but died
two days later of his wounds. Strozzi, according to some accounts, was
treated with great barbarity; at any rate he was thrown overboard by
the orders of the Spanish Admiral. His gallant end, and the cruelty of
his captors, excited a strong feeling in France, which found expression in
epigrams, of which the following is a specimen.

of Rouen, for forging money. The Guises, who had need of his
services, obtained his pardon, or to speak more correctly perhaps, a suspension
of his sentence, for his pardon was not registered by the Parliament
of Rouen, though granted by the King. His mission, according to
Motley, was to poison Alençon and Orange, but according to Salceda’s
own confession he was to join Alençon with some troops, gain his confidence,
and get himself appointed to the command of Dunkirk or some
other strong place, which he was to betray to the Guises. These last
were then to rise and compel the King to place them at the head of his
army which they intended to lead against Alençon and Orange. On
being arrested Salceda made various confessions implicating the Guises
and other leading men in France. Christopher de Thou, President of
the Parliament of Paris, one of those before whom he was tried, was convinced
that there was a great deal of truth in Salceda’s statements, and
was most anxious that his life should be spared with a view to bringing
others to justice, but too many great people were interested in stopping
the mouth of their unfortunate tool, and he was therefore executed. It is
probable that the story of an attempt to poison Alençon and Orange
was a mere veil to cover the grounds on which he was executed. The
fact that a distinguished Netherlander, Lamoral Egmont, cousin of the
French Queen, and son of the famous general, was concerned in Salceda’s
plot, seems to point to the accuracy of de Thou’s version. It is evident
that Busbecq thought there was something more in the matter than appeared
on the surface. Compare <cite>Thuanus</cite>, iii. 565-566, and especially
the account in his life. <cite>De vita suâ</cite>, 27-31. Miss Freer gives a very
full and interesting account of Salceda’s conspiracy; see <cite>Henry III.</cite> vol.

in the daughter of Maréchal de Brissac; when they were married she
objected to her husband’s taking part in the dissipations of the Court.
St. Luc, anxious to remain in the Court circle, and at the same time
desirous of gratifying his wife, determined to frighten Henry into
reforming his ways. Accordingly he had a secret passage cut through
the panels of the King’s bedchamber, and one night presented himself
dressed up in the character of an angel. With a piece of brass piping he
imitated the scene of Belshazzar’s feast, and threatened the King with a
most horrible fate if he did not reform his ways. The King was completely
taken in and thoroughly frightened. For sometime afterwards,
whenever it thundered, the King imagined it to be the sign of his approaching
doom, and took refuge under the beds, and in the cellars of the
palace. Unfortunately for St. Luc he could not keep the joke to himself;
at last the King heard of it, his fears were relieved, and his favourite
was dismissed.</p></div>

thus, as has been already stated, she was willing to sell her

The Latin is <em>Montenellus</em>, and we have identified him with <em>Montal</em>

to the death of de Viteaux, and possibly Louvier de Montrevel (or
Maurevert) is intended, who was killed about this time by the son of a man
he had assassinated. This atrocious scoundrel had been like Besme
(see p. <a href="#Page_99">99</a>) a page in the household of Guise, had murdered the governor
of the pages and deserted. In spite of his crime he was readmitted to
his old position, and undertook to murder Coligny. With this object he
deserted to the Huguenots, and was most kindly received by Moüy,
governor of Niort, who shared with him his bed, his board, and his
purse. Unable to find an opportunity of assassinating the Admiral,
Montrevel murdered his benefactor in the most dastardly manner.
Mezeray draws a parallel between him and de Viteaux, who had at least

instance, a gentleman named Saint-Phal was looking at a piece of embroidery,
and made the innocent remark that a certain letter worked on
it was X; Bussy, in order to provoke a quarrel, insisted that it was Y.
The upshot of the dispute was a duel with six champions on either side;
at the first meeting Bussy was slightly wounded, on which Saint-Phal
withdrew from the combat. Bussy endeavoured to arrange another
meeting, but was prevented by the King.
</p>
<p>
His end was as follows. The King obtained some letters of Bussy’s
boasting of an intrigue with a married lady, and showed them to her husband,
the Count of Monsoreau. The latter carried off his wife to a
lonely castle and compelled her to write a letter to Bussy, inviting him to
visit her. He fell into the trap, and was murdered by a band of assassins
as soon as he entered the castle. No one regretted him, not even
Alençon, to whom he had attached himself.—<cite lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Ambassadeurs Vénetiens</cite>,
ii. 453.
</p>
<p>
Bussy’s sister Renée afterwards married Balagny (see Letter <a href="#xxix">XXIX</a>.)
on condition that he would avenge her brother, a promise he never fulfilled.
She is the heroine of Cambrai described by Motley, <cite>United
Netherlands</cite>, iii. 350, 351.</p></div>

Azores (see Letter <a href="#vi">VI</a>.) was to provide for the safety of the fleet which
was expected from India. Telles Silva, having secured Goa and the other
Portuguese possessions in India for Spain, despatched a messenger, Jerome
Lima, to Philip by an overland route, viâ Ormuz, Bagdad, Aleppo, Jerusalem,
and Tripoli, to inform him of his plans. Matters appear to have
been well timed by the Spaniards, for shortly after the defeat of Strozzi
the Indian fleet hove in sight, and Santa Cruz, after throwing a garrison
into St. Michael, escorted the convoy to Lisbon. Don Antonio was thus
left master of the other islands, but, as has already been seen, he quickly
decamped, leaving Emmanuel Silva in command. The following year
the French sent their second expedition, consisting of 600 men under de
Chattes, Knight of Malta; on reaching Terceira this gallant officer
strongly urged the Portuguese commander to concentrate his troops in
some strong place, as he saw no hope of preventing the Spaniards, who
were shortly expected, from disembarking. Silva refused to take his advice;
Santa Cruz succeeded in landing, and after a sharp engagement the
French, who were deserted by their Portuguese allies, were driven into
the interior.
</p>
<p>
De Chattes asked Silva to join him, suggesting that with their united
forces they would be able to offer a better resistance or secure better
terms. Silva returned a most insolent answer, telling him to join the
Spaniards, and boasting that he and his Portuguese were a match for
them both, meanwhile he sent to Santa Cruz, offering to surrender and
betray his French allies. This proposition the Spanish admiral forwarded
to de Chattes by a man who had served with the latter at Malta. De
Chattes no longer hesitated to accept the liberal terms offered by Santa
Cruz, and surrendered with 400 men, on condition of their keeping their
side arms, and being sent back to France. Silva was quickly hunted
down, tortured, and executed. The French who had been taken prisoners
before the surrender of the main body were sent to the galleys. See

that Alençon did not care to come to court. Henry III. allowed and

mimicking him to his face, and pointing at him. The following is the
description of their behaviour at St. Luc’s wedding:—‘<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Le duc d’Anjou

accounted for by a very amusing story told by Thuanus. As Chancellor
of France he was commanded by the King to make a speech before the
Parliament asking for the confirmation of some financial measures which
his Majesty had sent to them. Henry was present with all his courtiers.
Whether Birague intended the sarcasm or not it is impossible to say; but
to the great amusement of the ready-witted Frenchmen he said, looking
round on the royal favourites, ‘Really the causes of the King’s poverty
and want of money are so obvious that everyone can see them.’ He
repeated the phrase again and again, amid roars of laughter. See

Imbize. It appears from <cite>Thuanus</cite> (iii. 646) that Imbize, to gain the favour
of the people, immediately on becoming Senator, threw into prison certain
citizens, whom he accused of intriguing with the Spaniards, and having
betrayed the Pays de Waes to them. The trick succeeded; Imbize won
the confidence of the people, and, having attained his object, yielded to

diplomatists. He was the son of Jean Baptiste de Tassis, who in 1545
was appointed Postmaster General throughout Germany and the Netherlands
by Charles V., and whose uncle Francis had in 1516 established a
riding post between Brussels and Vienna by order of the Emperor Maximilian.
To his family, as Strada points out, the world is indebted for
the first regular system of posting in modern times—even down to 1866
the Princes of Thurn and Taxis managed the posts of Würtemberg,
Nassau, Hesse, the Hanse towns, and some other German principalities.
This is the point of James I.’s complaint that ‘Spain sent him a postilion-ambassador.’
Motley seems to explain the remark by stating
that Tassis was chief courier to Philip. It is hardly probable that a great
ambassador would be employed in such an office. See also note, p. <a href="#Page_28">28</a>.</p></div>

in full canonicals stood round the canopy of state. The surgeon of the
royal household introduced the sick. A passage from the sixteenth
chapter of the Gospel of Saint Mark was read. When the words, “They
shall lay hands on the sick, and they shall recover,” had been pronounced,
there was a pause, and one of the sick was brought up to the King. His

With this view he negotiated with Philip II., and introduced

when he was obliged to surrender to Henry IV. He then entered the
service of the Emperor Rodolph, and fought in Hungary against the
Turks. He died at Nuremberg on his way home in 1602. His only

and the siege of Meulan, it appears to have been written towards the end
of the first half of January 1590. Busbecq was probably then at Mantes,
the place from which the next letter was written. Mantes is about
twenty-five English miles from Evreux, which corresponds roughly with
ten of Busbecq’s miles. See vol. i. page <a href="http://www.gutenberg.org/files/53629/53629-h/53629-h.htm#Page_82">82</a>, note.</p></div>

<p><a name="Footnote_266_266" id="Footnote_266_266"></a><a href="#FNanchor_266_266"><span class="label">266</span></a> Pierre d’Espinac was born in 1540, and became Archbishop of
Lyons in 1574. He was Speaker, or Prolocutor, of the States-General
held at Blois in 1576. Catherine de Medici, when the Leaguers first took up
arms, sent him to negotiate with them (see p. <a href="#Page_246">246</a>.) However, he went over
to that party, and was thenceforth one of the strongest partisans of the
League. According to his own account, he was forced to take this step
by the insults he received from Epernon, the King’s favourite; his enemies,
on the other hand, asserted that his motive was the hope of gaining
a Cardinal’s hat. After the assassination of Guise, at Blois, in December
1588, the Archbishop was one of those arrested, and he shared the prison
of the Cardinal, the brother of the murdered duke. Each expected to
meet the same fate, and each confessed to the other, and received absolution
at his hands. The Cardinal was put to death the following day
without trial, but the Archbishop’s life was spared. On his trial he refused
to answer when interrogated by the judges, on the ground that, as Archbishop
and Primate, he was subject only to the jurisdiction of the Pope,
or of delegates appointed by him. He was then imprisoned at Amboise.
On his release he again joined the League, and was Mayenne’s strongest
partisan. He died in 1599, refusing to the last to acknowledge Henry IV.—<cite>Thuanus</cite>,
v. 855.</p></div>

from it his title of Comte de Nanteuil.</p></div>

Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions will

Creating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright
law means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,
so the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United
States without permission and without paying copyright
royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works to protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm
concept and trademark. Project Gutenberg is a registered trademark,
and may not be used if you charge for the eBooks, unless you receive
specific permission. If you do not charge anything for copies of this
eBook, complying with the rules is very easy. You may use this eBook
for nearly any purpose such as creation of derivative works, reports,
performances and research. They may be modified and printed and given
away--you may do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks
not protected by U.S. copyright law. Redistribution is subject to the
trademark license, especially commercial redistribution.

START: FULL LICENSE

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full
Project Gutenberg-tm License available with this file or online at
www.gutenberg.org/license.

Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works

1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the
person or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph
1.E.8.

1.B. "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the
Foundation" or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg-tm License when
you share it without charge with others.

1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg-tm work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country outside the United States.

1.E. Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1. The following sentence, with active links to, or other
immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work
on which the phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

  This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and
  most other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no
  restrictions whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use it
  under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included with this
  eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org. If you are not located in the
  United States, you'll have to check the laws of the country where you
  are located before using this ebook.

1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.3. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms
will be linked to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the
beginning of this work.

1.E.4. Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5. Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6. You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including
any word processing or hypertext form. However, if you provide access
to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format
other than "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means
of obtaining a copy upon request, of the work in its original "Plain
Vanilla ASCII" or other form. Any alternate format must include the
full Project Gutenberg-tm License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7. Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8. You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
provided that

* You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
  the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
  you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
  to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he has
  agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
  within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
  legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty
  payments should be clearly marked as such and sent to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the address specified in
  Section 4, "Information about donations to the Project Gutenberg
  Literary Archive Foundation."

* You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
  you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.

* You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of
  any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
  electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days of
  receipt of the work.

* You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
  distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9. If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work or group of works on different terms than
are set forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing
from both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and The
Project Gutenberg Trademark LLC, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark. Contact the Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT
LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in
accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org



Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation

The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit
501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal
Revenue Service. The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification
number is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
